1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) re port provides the detailed description 
of the functionalities required for the first versi on of the CCTNS. The key guiding principle 
behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to fo cus on the critical functionality that 
provides value to the police personnel at the cutti ng edge which in turn can improve the 
outcomes in the areas of “Investigation of Crime” a nd “Detection of Criminals”. 
 
2. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW 
 
CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on de livering value to IOs, records room 
staff and citizens within the broad crime investiga tion area. Based on the guiding principles 
stated above, nine different function blocks have b een identified and the detailed 
functionality of each block was determined. 
 
 
 
 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 4 of 19 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
The functionality of the CCTNS application is focus ed on providing value to the police 
personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day 
operations of the police function. 
 
Registration 
Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and 
following investigation, police shall take the comp laint forward. The Registration module 
acts as an interface between the police and citizen s and it eases the approach, interaction and 
information exchange between police and complainant s. 
 
Investigation 
After a complaint is initiated, police initiates th e investigation process. The Investigation 
module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation p rocess and introduces operational 
efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that t ake place after initial entries are made 
during Registration. 
 
Prosecution 
Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the 
responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station 
constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecut ion module of the CCTNS aids this 
interfacing by providing a platform to record entri es of the court interactions. 
 
Search 
The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personn el the ability to execute a basic or 
advanced search on cases. Using the search function ality, police personnel can search for a 
particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, p roperty etc. It also gives the user the 
ability to customize the results view by criminal/a ccused or by cases. It makes reporting easy 
for police by enabling them to execute different ty pes of queries such as monthly reporting, 
RTI related etc. 
 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 5 of 19 Citizen Interface 
The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange 
between citizens and police units/personnel. Citize ns can use it as a tool to get information 
or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with 
very little turnaround time. It improves overall pr oductivity by helping citizens and police to 
cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwor k. 
 
Navigation 
The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role ba sed landing pages which help in 
navigating through the CCTNS application. It shows information such as cases assigned, 
alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police pers onnel to plan better and execute with 
greater efficiency. 
 
Application Configuration 
The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep th e application configured according 
to the states’ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a 
proper configuration, information such as act and s ections, state specific data, castes, tribes, 
property information etc. can be created updated an d deleted. 
 
The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate 
enclosures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 6 of 19 4. NON -FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
The non-functional requirements specify the qualita tive attributes such as user-friendliness 
and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user-acceptance of the 
application. 
 
Help Module 
1. The solution should provide detailed context-sensit ive help material for all the 
possible actions and scenarios on all user interfac es in the application. 
2. The help should be accessible to the users both in the offline and online mode 
 
Support Module 
1. The solution should provide an interface for the us er to log any defects or 
enhancement requests on the application and track t hereafter. 
2. The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user chooses 
to whenever any action has been taken on the alert 
3. The solution should enable the user to track the su bmitted defect or 
enhancement request. 
4. The solution should enable the help-desk user to vi ew the reports on the 
submitted defects or enhancement requests category- wise, status-wise, and age-
wise. 
5. The support solution should be accessible to the us ers both from within the 
application and also outside the application throug h a browser interface. 
 
 Audit Module 
1. An audit trail is a record of actions taken by eith er the user or the system 
triggers. This includes actions taken by users or A dministrators, or actions 
initiated automatically by the system as a result o f system parameters. The 
System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing 
and storing information about: 
• All the actions (create/read/update/delete) that ar e taken upon the critical 
entities (case, suspect, property,…) in the system 
• The user initiating and or carrying out the action; 
• The date and time of the event. 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 7 of 19 • Administrative parameters 
The word “unalterable” is to mean that the audit tr ail data cannot be modified 
in any way or deleted by any user; it may be subjec t to re-department and 
copying to removable media if required, so long as its contents remain 
unchanged. 
2. Once the audit trail functionality has been activat ed, the System must track 
events without manual intervention, and store in th e audit trail information 
about them. 
3. The System must maintain the audit trail for as lon g as required, which will be at 
least for the life of the case to which it refers. 
4. The System must ensure that audit trail data is ava ilable for inspection on 
request, so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made 
accessible, and that this can be achieved by author ised external personnel who 
have little or no familiarity with the system. 
5. The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases (without 
affecting the audit trail stored by the System). Th is functionality can be used by 
external auditors who wish to examine or analyse sy stem activity. 
6. The System must be able to capture and store violat ions (i.e. A user’s attempts 
to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly 
be attempted) attempted violations, of access contr ol mechanisms. 
7. The System must at a minimum be able to provide rep orts for actions on cases 
organised: 
• By case; 
• By user; 
• In chronological sequence. 
8. The System should be able to provide reports for ac tions on cases organised by 
workstation and (where technically appropriate) by network address. 
 
The requirements specify the requirements to contro l the user access to correspondences, 
files, and records and various functionalities prov ided within the system. 
Access Module 
1. The System must allow the user to limit access to c ases to specified users or 
user groups. 
2. The system should provide for role-based control fo r the functionality within 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 8 of 19 the system. 
3. The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group. 
4. The System must allow only admin-users to set up us er profiles and allocate 
users to groups. 
5. The System should allow a user to stipulate which o ther users or groups can 
access cases. 
6. The System must allow changes to security attribute s for groups or users (such 
as access rights, security level, privileges, passw ord allocation and management) 
to be made only by super-user. 
7. If a user requests access to, or searches for, a ca se which he does not have the 
right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses 
(selectable at configuration time): 
• display title and metadata; 
• display the existence of a case but not its title o r other metadata; 
• do not display any case information or indicate its existence in any way. 
These options are presented in order of increasing security. Note that the 
requirement in the third option (i.e. the most stri ngent) implies that the System 
must not include such cases in any count of search results; this level of security 
is normally appropriate for cases dealing with matt ers such as national security. 
8. If a user performs a quick or advanced search, the System must never include in 
the search result list any record which the user do es not have the right to access. 
9. If the System allows users to make unauthorised att empts to access cases, it 
must log these in the audit trail. 
10. Any access to cases, and all other activities invol ving the cases and related 
documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal 
admissibility and to assist in data recovery. 
 
Ease of Use 
1. All error messages produced by the System must be m eaningful, so that they can be 
appropriately acted upon by the users who are likel y to see them. Ideally, each error 
message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the action(s) 
which the user can take in response to the error. 
2. The System must employ a single set of user interfa ce rules, or a small number of 
sets to provide a familiar and common look and feel for the application. 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 9 of 19 3. The System must be able to display several entities (cases, suspects) simultaneously. 
4. The interfaces must be made customizable or user-co nfigurable to the extent 
possible. (e.g., the displayed columns in the table , move, resize, modify the 
appearance). Such configurations must be saved in t he user profile. 
5. The System user interface must be suitable for user s with special needs; that is, 
compatible with specialist software that may be use d and with appropriate interface 
guidelines 
6. The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to 
use and intuitive throughout. 
7. The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable. These 
defaults should include: 
• user-definable values; 
• values same as previous item; 
• values derived from context, e.g. date, file refere nce, user identifier; 
8. Frequently-executed System transactions must be des igned so that they can be 
completed with a small number of interactions (e.g. mouse clicks). 
9. Where the System employs a graphical user interface , it must allow users to 
customise it. Customisation should include, but nee d not be limited to the following 
changes: 
• menu contents; 
• layout of screens; 
• use of function keys; 
• on-screen colours, fonts and font sizes; 
 
Usability 
1. The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive. 
2. The user interfaces of the system should comply wit h Standard ISO 9241. 
3. ICT accessibility: ISO 9241-20 shall be the standar d for guidance on ICT 
accessibility. Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and 
recommendations. Software accessibility ISO 9241-17 1 shall be the standard for 
guidance on software accessibility. User interfaces should meet its requirements 
and recommendations. Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used 
for guidance on content accessibility. The applicat ion logo to be available on all 
pages as a link to the home page. 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 10 of 19 4. Providing text equivalents for non-text media objec ts: All non-text media objects, 
such as graphical images or video, should be provid ed with alternative equivalent 
textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-ba sed functionality. 
5. Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation shou ld be designed to help users 
understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. 
General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110. 
6. Showing users where they are: Each presentation seg ment (page or window) 
should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is 
in the navigation structure and of the current segm ent position with respect to the 
overall structure. 
7. Offering alternative access paths: Alternative acce ss paths for navigating to a 
specific unit of content should be offered to suppo rt different navigation 
strategies. 
8. Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigat ion steps needed to reach a 
certain piece of content should be minimized as lon g as different mental models, 
navigation strategies and tasks of the user are tak en into account. 
9. Splash screens should be avoided unless they provid e useful content or feedback 
about the application state to the user. If a splas h screen is used, a navigation 
option to skip it should be offered. 
10. Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional wi ndows such as new browser 
windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the user’s 
task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of 
reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, h iding relevant information. 
They could make it cognitively more difficult to un derstand the navigation 
structure with negative effects on both usability a nd accessibility. They also require 
additional user actions for closing unwanted window s. 
11. Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important 
information at the top and providing links to infor mation that is further down the 
page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherev er possible. 
12. Designing for input device independence: User inter faces should be designed to 
allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose 
between different input devices for activating cont rols such as links, fields and 
buttons is important both for users who prefer a ce rtain input mode, mobile users 
and users with disabilities. In general, device ind ependence can be achieved if the 
functionality is operable via a keyboard. 
13. Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces shou ld be designed to be as robust 
as possible in the face of changing technology. Thi s encompasses being able to 
present content containing newer technologies by ol der user agents as well as 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 11 of 19 designing content to be usable with future technolo gies. 
14. Acceptable opening / download times: Application pa ges should be designed and 
implemented so that there are acceptable opening ti mes and download times for 
the expected range of technical contexts of use (e. g. bandwidth between the 
application and the user). This is particularly imp ortant for frequently accessed 
pages or pages that are important for user navigati on and exploration, such as the 
home page. 
15. Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as w ell as the effort needed to 
recover from errors should be minimized. 
16. Providing clear error messages: The content of erro r messages shown on the pages 
or special error pages should clearly state the rea son why the error occurred and, if 
possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages 
to be in the same language as the user interface. 
17. Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency: When designing 
user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input an d output of information 
elements such as currency, units of measurement, te mperatures, date and time, 
phone numbers, address or postal codes should be de signed so that they are 
usable. 
18. Making text resizable by the user: Text should be a ble to be resized by the user, 
using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 
9241-171. 
19. Text quality: The quality of textual content with r espect to spelling and grammar 
should be sufficient so as not to impede readabilit y. 
20. Writing style: The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen 
should be supported by suitable means, including th e use of short sentences, the 
division of the text into shorter chunks or the pre sentation of content items in the 
form of bullet points. 
21. Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text sho uld be supported by the 
provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlight ed keywords, logical headings, and 
short phrases and sentences. 
22. Readability of text: Text presented on the pages sh ould be readable taking into 
account the expected display characteristics and sp atial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 
shall be consulted for screen text legibility requi rements. 
23. Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page link s should be clearly 
distinguishable from other links that lead to a dif ferent page. EX. Within-page 
links are shown with dashed rather than solid under lines 
24. Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing larg e proportions of links should 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 12 of 19 be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the 
text. 
25. Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Na vigation links — particularly 
links representing the main navigation structure — should be labelled with terms 
that are familiar to the user, based on his/her gen eral knowledge, prior experience 
in the application domain or experience of using ot her systems. 
26. Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpos e of a link should be directly 
indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels suc h as “go” or “click here” except 
where the purpose of the link is clear from its con text on the page or the labels 
have commonly understood semantics in the particula r application domain. Using 
appropriate terminology specific to the user’s task s and information needs is 
important for making the content easy to understand . 
27. Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or 
pop-up windows should be clearly marked. 
28. Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navi gation links should be clearly 
distinguishable from controls activating some actio n. Typical action types in user 
interfaces include manipulating application data, p erforming searches, 
communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat 
function, and □presentation-related actions, such a s sorting a list of search results. 
29. Providing printable document versions: If a documen t is either too long, dispersed 
over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a 
printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the 
content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in t he expected layout, paper format, 
or orientation). 
30. Use of “white space”: “White space” on a page i.e. space filled only with the 
background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual 
skimming of the page. While white space is an impor tant means of visually 
organizing the different content elements on a page , if the distance between the 
blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page 
can be impeded. 
31. Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to 
support the primary purpose and use of the page. Sh ort pages are generally more 
appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or ove rview pages that need to be 
read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the 
content without interruptions or when the page need s to match a paper 
counterpart. 
32. Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taki ng into account human 
capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of 
conveying information. Color should never be the on ly means of coding. Some 
users may have difficulties in perceiving certain c olors or color combinations 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 13 of 19 (color-blindness). 
33. Using frames with care: If frames are used, care sh ould be taken to avoid possible 
problems, for example, those involving the use of t he back button, bookmarking 
of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title 
each frame, and to describe its purpose and how fra mes relate to one another 
other. 
34. Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an 
alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be 
provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: Wh en style sheets and/or frames 
are turned off it should be possible for the user t o read and understand the page; 
alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only 
page. 
35. Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed us ing consistent layout schemes, 
supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different 
pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages an d are preferable when all pages 
have a similar structure. Frequently, however, diff erent pages have different 
purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in 
different categories, using one layout scheme for e ach category consistently. 
36. Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent 
location on the different pages. 
37. Observing principles of human perception When desig ning application pages, the 
general principles of human perception should be ta ken into account. The 
International Standards mentioned below shall be co nsulted for guidance. Practical 
guidelines for presenting information to the user a re to be found in ISO 9241-12. 
Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be 
found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gi ves guidance about menus, 
ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 ab out direct manipulation 
and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when desi gning multimedia 
information presentations, the design principles an d recommendations described 
in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content 
presentation also plays a key role in accessibility . 
38. Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Ea ch page should contain a 
link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy 
to recognize for the user. 
39. Providing a site map: A separate navigation overvie w such as a site map should be 
provided for application showing the structure of t he site in an overview form. 
40. Consistency between navigation components and conte nt: If navigation 
components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, 
consistency between the navigation component and th e content shown should be 
maintained by indicating in the navigation compone nt (e.g. highlighting) the topic 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 14 of 19 currently visible in the content area. 
41. Placing navigation components consistently: Navigat ion components should be 
placed consistently on the pages or in the frameset s in the pages of the application. 
42. Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting th e content and the navigation of 
a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for 
providing information that is of interest to the us ers and for making access to 
relevant information more efficient. User adaptatio n can also be important for 
making the user interface more accessible. Differen t approaches can be used for 
achieving these goals, like providing users with me ans for customizing the user 
interface to their personal needs i.e. individualiz ation designing content and 
navigation differently for varying user groups or r oles i.e. such as employees of 
different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user ’s behaviour and adapting to the 
user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour o bserved, recommending 
information that is potentially more relevant or in teresting to the specific user, 
based on the behaviour of all users or a user group . 
43. Taking account of the users’ tasks and information needs: When providing 
different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks 
and information needs of these user groups should b e taken into consideration. 
44. Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the 
user when individualization and/or adaptation are u sed. 
45. Making user profiles evident: If predefined user pr ofiles or user-specified profiles 
are used for individualizing or adapting content, t he profile currently used should 
be made evident. If profiles are used, it is import ant to provide users with 
information about this concept and its implications . 
46. Allowing users to see and change profiles: If user- specified profiles are used, users 
should be able to see, modify and delete that profi le on demand. 
47. The user interfaces of the system should follow the guidelines specified under 
www.usability.gov 
 
 
System Availability 
1. The System must be available to users: 
• from <xx:00> to <xx:00>; 
• on <all weekdays/xxx days per year>. 
2. The planned downtime for the System must not exceed <xx> hours per <rolling 
three month period>. 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 15 of 19 The System is considered to be down if any user is unable to perform any normal 
System function and if this failure is attributed t o any component of the System 
other than the workstation. 
3. Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed < xx hours/minutes> per 
<rolling three month period>. 
4. The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for t he System must not exceed 
<x> per <rolling three month period>. 
5. In the event of any software or hardware failure, i t must be possible to restore the 
System (with inline synchronization) within no more than <xx> hours. 
 
 
Performance and Scalability 
1. The System must provide adequate response times for commonly performed 
functions under both standard and peak conditions 
2. The System must be able to perform a simple search within 5-8 seconds and a 
advanced search (multiple search criteria) within 1 0-15 seconds regardless of the 
storage capacity or number of cases in the system. In this context, performing a 
search means returning a result list. It does not include retrieving the records 
themselves. 
3. The System must be able to retrieve and display wit hin 5-8 seconds the case which 
has been accessed within the previous 2 months, reg ardless of storage capacity or 
number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for rapid 
retrieval of frequently-used cases, on the understa nding that frequency of use is 
typically correlated with recent use. 
4. The System must be able to retrieve and display wit hin 20 seconds the case which 
has not been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity 
or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for cases 
where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active 
records. 
5. The System be scaleable and must not have any featu res which would preclude use 
in small or large police stations, with varying num bers of cases handled.

Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 16 of 19 5. FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The proposed functional architecture is modeled aro und centralized deployment to facilitate 
ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in ope n standards and web technologies. 
 
The 3 C’s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the 
architecture. The functional architecture of the CC TNS solution is given in the figure below. 
The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. 
Each of the components contains multiple services a s defined by Service Definition. The 
core services, support layer and security and acces s control components can be deployed as 
standard components with necessary configuration ch anges. The customization layer can 
override and add to the core services based on the specific state requirements and can be 
plugged with the core services. 
 
CCTNS Functional Architecture Overview 
 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminal s Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs Draft Core Scope Document Page 17 of 19 The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be configured and 
customized as per the state specific extensions. 
 
The systems should be designed with the following b road guidelines: 
 
System Functionality 
1) The system should support multilingual interface 
2) The system should be designed in manner that operat ional data is not lost in case of any 
failure of equipment or communication network. 
3) The system should work even in an offline mode with the critical functionality 
4) The system should be designed to have satisfactory performance even in Police Stations 
connected on low-bandwidth 
5) The system should be implemented using Service Orie nted Architecture (SOA) and have a 
modular design 
6) The system should be developed on Open Standards 
7) The system should be built on a common User Access and Authentication Service to 
ensure Single-Sign on for the end-user 
8) The system should be developed for a centralized de ployment and maintenance 
9) The system should be developed to be deployed in a 3-tier datacenter architecture 
10) The system should be designed to have a n-tier arch itecture with the presentation logic 
separated from the business logic that is again sep arated from the data-access logic
