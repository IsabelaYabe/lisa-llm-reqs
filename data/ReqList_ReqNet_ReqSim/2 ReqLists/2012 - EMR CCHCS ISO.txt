11.1	All transmissions and data-links sending PHI or PI data between the application/system and the Database Management System (DBMS) should be encrypted using FIPS 140-2 validated software; refer to "Attachment 8 - EMR Technical Evaluation Criteria - Worksheet" as appropriate
12.1	Solution shall be segmented into three layers, separating at a minimum the Presentation, Application/Business Logic, and Data Persistence/Database layers.  These layers shall be separated by an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Layer 3 or Layer 4 firewall, and configured with only the minimum necessary open ports and protocols.  A Layer 4 firewall with anomaly detection and/or heuristics capabilities is recommended.  The Presentation layer must only contain systems that provide services directly to the Internet. These protocols include DNS, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and encrypted FTP servers. Any system that the web tier communicates with, but that does not provide a direct internet service (such as directory services, middleware, etc.) must be installed on the Application layer. Where unfeasible to separate the Presentation and Application/Business Logic layers, a proxy server may be used to isolate non-Presentation layer services.  This must be documented in the application’s approved security plan.
13.1	Direct access to the Data Persistence/Database layer is only permitted through a logical Data Access logic layer, using a trusted sub-system that utilizes a single database access account for all transactions. The Data Access Logic Layer shall take the form of stored procedures, database API, Data Access Objects/Components, Data Access Middleware, Shared Data Services, or Secure Web Service. System requests made to the Business logic and Data Access logic layers shall be authenticated and authorized. Dynamic SQL shall not be permitted from the Presentation Layer.   Applications shall use an alias for every table and column, so that Database table names and column names shall not be exposed."
14.1	Solution shall enforce validation of user input before accepting it, and before being committed to the database or other application information repository.  Data queries from the Presentation or the Business Logic layers shall be validated for appropriate use of query language, and validated for appropriate quantity and quality of data input.  This includes In-line Structured Query Language (SQL) calls. The system shall validate client input on the server side to the extent possible.
15.1	Administrative/Privileged accounts are any special User ID’s that are created for system administration or elevated privilege purposes by a single individual.  These requirements apply to any such type of account with administrative privileges or any other type of escalated privileges.  System administration shall be performed using a different username than the one used for daily non-administrative activities. Administrative accounts must be used only for administrative activity within the authorized role of that account and the individual using it. It must be logged out of immediately after administrative work is complete.  Generic accounts not linked to a specific person, such as service accounts, must not be used in accessing PHI or PI, or in making changes to IT systems which protect that data, unless there are logs in place that identify the actual individual who accessed the data or made the system change.
16.1	Solution should provide secure role-based access for authorization utilizing the principle of least privilege at all layers/tiers. Applications shall in all cases default to explicitly deny access where authentication and/or authorization mechanisms are required.  No application that requires a login shall offer to or be capable of remembering a user’s credentials. There shall be role separation between system/server administrators and application/database administrators, using the principle of least privilege.
17.1	For any application which accesses PHI or PI, the following technical controls shall be present, unless an exception is granted by the agency's ISO: o The application shall use ‘least privileged accounts’ to execute code and to access SQL databases; o User access rights shall be authenticated on entry to each application tier; o All user input shall be validated, including parameters passed to public web service methods; o Information that is not required shall not be exposed; o If a web application fails, it shall not leave sensitive data unprotected or expose any details in error messages presented to the user.  Any exceptions shall be logged or emailed to the appropriate team member; o Any sensitive data stored in session, cookies, disk files etc., shall be encrypted.   o Applications shall be protected from the Internet by a web application firewall/gateway/proxy, which shall be included in the documented system design; o Post back Universal Resource Locators (URLs) shall not contain unencrypted record identifiers or database keys; o Post back URLs shall not include query strings.
18.1	The solution must be scanned for vulnerabilities and the high and medium vulnerabilities must be resolved and mitigated.
19.1	The solution should undergo a penetration testing to ensure the solution has no flaws, and the high or medium vulnerabilities detected must be resolved and mitigated.
20.1	The solution if providing access to PI or PHI from the Internet should assess the need for additional strong authentication, to prevent a significant data breach if a password is compromised. Strong authentication is defined as additional mandatory authentication over and beyond the password, for each account which has direct access to PI/PHI, or which has administrative privileges. The following methods are approved for strong authentication: o Physical Token; o One Time Password (OTP); o X.509 Certificate; o Firewall Rules. • The following strong authentication method is approved for personal data access, where accounts have access to only the account holder’s personal data, or a single data record they are custodian over such as a family member or information about their company.  For example, an application where a client can submit or edit an enrollment form for themselves or someone else, but cannot access any other data records. o Personal Challenge Questions.
