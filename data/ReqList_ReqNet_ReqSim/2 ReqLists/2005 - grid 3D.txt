2.2.1.1	The product shall plot the data points in a scientifically correct manner.
2.2.1.2	The grid axis should  be labelled correctly according to the input from the data file.
2.2.1.3	Data points should be coloured in accordance to the cluster number (contained in the data file)
2.2.1.4	The product should be able to handle up to 2000 data points.
2.2.1.5	A single click of the mouse over a data point should bring up the name of the data point.
2.2.1.6	A double-click of the mouse over the data point should cause the application to display all the data point's details.
2.2.1.7	The product should allow multiple points to clicked so that multiple names can be displayed.
2.2.1.8	The product should allow the grid to be oriented by the user. Rotation, zoom and move functions should be employed.
2.2.2.1	The data file should contain: - A name for the data point - 3 parameters from which the data point is to be plotted - A single parameter to designate the colour of the point - A description for the data point
3.1.1	The points should be large enough to see and select
3.1.2	The points should not be too big, so as to distort the overall pattern of the point spread.
3.1.3	The axis should be clearly labelled and easily recognised after the grid has been oriented into a different position.
3.1.4	The application should be coloured so that the screen shots can be printed out clearly (i.e., black on white background).
3.1.5	The application should be intuitive and not require any specialist training.
3.2.1	The program should start within 30 seconds. This depends on the number of data points that are to be plotted.
3.2.2	The interaction with the data points should have a delay of no longer than 2 seconds.
3.2.3	The response to a change in the orientation should be fast enough to avoid interrupting the user's flow of thought.
