4.1.1	The Get Real site should work and be tested against IE, Firefox and Netscape.
4.2.1	There are no special hardware interface requirements.
5.1.1	The Get Real site should be hosted on a server that can provide adequate response time.  High school students tend to have short attentions spans, so a slow server would not be satisfactory for this application.  The current OUS (www.ous.edu) site is a good example of rapid response time.
5.2.1	Copyright and other security measures for Get Real should be the same as the OUS site.  5.3 There is a need to track and evaluate the “hits” and time spent on the student-focused website over time; and make content, design, and navigation changes as needed based on evaluation of hits.
5.3.1	Web design conventions should be consistent with the standards and conventions used on the OUS site.
