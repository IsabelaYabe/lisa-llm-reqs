2.2.4.2.8	Systems supporting OM should have the ability to classify entities associated with the investigation as investigation controls.  For  example, controls  share  demographic characteristics with the subject of the case, but are not infected with  the agent that is the focus of the investigation.
2.2.4.3.1	Exposure investigation data to be captured must include information related to exposure levels, type of  exposure (e.g., intimate, social, household, common conveyance), place of exposure, length of time the entity was exposed, frequency of exposure, and the entity’s proximity to the source of exposure.
2.2.4.3.2	Detailed data must be collected about the source of exposure as well as the exposed entity to support contact exposure tracing.
