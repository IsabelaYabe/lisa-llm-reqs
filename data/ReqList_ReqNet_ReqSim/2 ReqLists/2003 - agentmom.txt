2.1.1	java version 1.4.0 is required to use the software.
2.1.2	TCP/IP is used in order to send unicast message. Multicast protocol is used in order to send multicast message. UDP is used in order to send broadcast message.
2.2.1	Enable agents to broadcast a message to all the agents within the same local network.
2.2.2	Enable agents to multicast a message to all the agents within the same multicast address.
2.2.3	Enable agents to unicast a message to other agents within organization.
2.2.4	Allow agents to choose among unicast, multicast and broadcast communication.
2.2.5	Allow agents to join and leave multicast group.
2.2.6	Provide message encryption and decryption techniques for secured communication.
2.2.7	Allow agents to choose to encrypt or not to encrypt message.
2.4.1	multicast/broadcast packets are delivered with best effort. Thus, a packet may be delivered to all specified agents or none.
2.4.2	we provide some basic mechanisms for security such as message encryption. However, there is no guarantee that the others cannot decrypt the encrypted messages
2.4.3	in order to send multicast message, network environment such as router, network card and operating systems must support multicast protocol.
2.4.4	in many network, only system administrator is allowed to send broadcast message.
2.5.1	We assume that each agent knows the address of destinating agents in order to send unicast message.
2.5.2	We assume that each agent has enough knowledge to decide the best way to communicate with the other agents.
2.5.3	In the case of using secured multicast communication, we assume that there is an agent whom each agent can request for the same encryption and decryption key. This agent should maintain a list of agents who are allowed to get the keys.
2.5.4	We assume that each agent knows the multicast address in order to send multicast message.

3.2.4.1	agentMom shall support the ability to encrypt unicast message.
3.2.4.2	agentMom shall support the ability to decrypt unicast message.
3.2.4.3	agentMom shall allow an agent to decide whether or not to encrypt a message.
3.2.4.4	agentMom shall automatically decrypt encrypted message.
3.2.4.5	agentMom shall support the ability to encrypt multicast message.
3.2.4.6	agentMom shall support the ability to decrypt multicast message.
3.2.5.1	agentMom with shall support the use of the architecture that agent directly controls the conversations.
3.2.5.2	agentMom shall support the use of the architecture that agentâ€™s components control the conversations.
3.2.6.1	The new built agentMom shall be compatible with the agentMom 1.2
