2.3.1	System operator: Staff at OCIO responsible for maintaining executable code, requiring full access to all aspects of the system.
2.3.2	Data operations manager: Staff, probably at OCIO, responsible for data archiving and maintenance, requiring read/write/modify privileges to all data in the system.  This includes the role commonly thought of as a Database Administrator (DBA).
2.3.3	Watershed uploaders: Staff in the watersheds  who have responsibility to upload local data requiring write access to space allocated to their specific watershed.
2.3.4	ARS users: ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes. These would likely be conversant with the general characteristics of the data content, and to a lesser extent have abilities manipulating views of the data using database tools such as envisioned for this database system. These users will need user/password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to data protected through the confidentiality agreements among agencies participating in CEAP.
2.3.5	Research users: Non-ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes. These would have similar characteristics and needs as ARS users, but because of the agency-level confidentiality issues, could not access the password-protected sensitive data.
2.3.6	Public users: Eventual release of the database system to the general public will add university and agency researchers who would appear similar in training to the primary users, but also would add clients with the entire range of training and interests. These users would have access to the public data  without need for authentication.
2.4.1	The System shall operate with the following Web browsers: Micros oft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator version 4.7, Netscape versions 6 and 7, and FireFox.
2.4.2	The System shall operate on Certified and Accredited servers running the current corporate approved versions of operating systems as appropriate.
2.4.3	The Data Management portion of the system shall permit user access from the corporate Intranet and, if a user is authorized for outside access through the corporate firewall, from an Internet connection at the user’s home.
2.4.4	The Data Research and Re porting portion of the system shall provide public access to reviewed and approved data sets.
2.5.1	Portability: The application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly when re-hosting the data system to a non-Windows OS or transferring the data system to another location.
2.5.2	Database Design: The database structure should be as complete as possible during the design stage but there should be a room for modification without a large overhaul during later phases.
2.5.3	Data uploading and management will likely be done as infrequently as once a year.  This fact greatly limits the complexity of the user interface and the learning curve needed for completing this task.
2.5.4	The system shall use the current corporate standard Microsoft SQL Server database engine.
2.5.5	The system shall be in compliance with all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security policies applicable.
2.5.6	As part of standard operating procedures, a testing plan will be documented during the Design phase. The testing plan will be based on user roles, modules or use cases, required tasks and expected outcomes.
2.6.1	A tutorial will provide a quick start, a walk-thru of major system features, and further reference source for the complete system features.
2.6.2	An online hierarchical and cross-linked help system in HTML will describe and illustrate all system functions.
2.6.3	An online form will enable users to request help. Frequently asked questions will be screened for the FAQ pages.
2.6.4	The user's guide (or user manual) will contain sufficient information and instructions required to access and use the da ta system. It will include: Overview of the system features and architecture; Instructions for accessing the system; Samples of screens, where appropriate.
3.1.0	The standardized data structure will facilitate database development, storage, and maintenance; metadata development, storage, and maintenance; and support database functionality, including tabular and spatial data queries,  evaluation, visualization, and transfer (downloading) to off-site locations.
3.1.1.1	The database management system should be stable and secured, have high performance (in terms of speed and efficiency/effectiveness), and be easy to maintain. This component is central to the effort and is thus of highest priority.
3.1.2.1	The team will elicit user requirements from a cross- section of user class members (see section 2.3) to accurately and completely describe the expected uses and functionality of the system.  To elicit requirements, the user class members will be as ked via conferencing, interviews, and email, to provide a detailed description of  the user actions and system responses that will take place during execution of the use case under normal, expected conditions. The summation of responses will lead to an accurate and complete inventory of user requirements.
3.1.3.1	Establish a database in support of CE AP that will house the collective data assembled or generated during research activities.  The database will support a variety of data types and formats, including but not limited to: spatial data - vector, raster, imagery, and tabular; tabular data  – static and time-series; spreadsheets; documents; reports; photographs; and URL links.
3.1.3.2	The use of agricultural models (SWAT, AnnAGNPS) is a core element of the CEAP effort.  Several modeling-related data base topics will need to be addressed:
3.1.3.2.1	Maintenance and reporting of uncertainty or error in measured data, in spatial components of GIS data, and in modeling output. Reporting of uncertainty may take place on an individual sample basis, on a method or procedural basis, or on an entire database.
3.1.3.2.2	Models will require specific input data and will generate output data during the calibration and validation phases, sensitivity analyses, and exploratory scenarios.  The current scope of the STEWARDS system is to provide measured data for input to the model and for comparison to output.
3.4.1.1	The system needs to be able to store hundreds of megabytes of data on demand.  The potential for needing Giga bytes of data storage capacity is also in the realm of possibilities.  Further requirements gathering is needed to get real-world estimates of such data storage needs.
3.4.1.2	All User and Application data as well as software installation and configuration files must be fully backed up week-nightly.  Further, secure, off-site storage will be performed on a weekly basis with 24-hour retrieval times.
3.4.2.1	Application Servers and Database servers must be load balanced at the application level to ensure maximum stability and availability.  Specific scenarios, such as fail-over versus session-managed load balancing need to be addressed in the functional requirements specification.
3.4.2.3	The system require s a “back-end” private network environment in order to ensure that end-user operations (on the front-end) are not impeded by database backups, index propagations, or other large back-end data transfers.
3.4.2.4	The system will use, where appropriate, the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the AR S OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hos ting site, network servers, and network management tools.
3.5.1	Backup Software – Data and application backups will be managed through fully supported backup software solutions.
3.5.2	HTTP and GIS Server Applications – As  the Web will be the primary delivery protocol for the application, HTTP and related GIS server  applications will be required to support system functionality.
3.5.3	Web Browsers and Browser Plug-ins – In support of External Interface requirements, commonly supported web browsers will be used to implement a thin-client architecture. The use of Browser plug-ins will be judiciously restricted on an as-needed basis.
3.5.4	Email Services – As a secondary delivery protocol for alerts, data, and other information from the system, email server applications will be required to support system functionality.
3.5.5	Relational Database Management System - As the primary data storage mechanism for the corporate standard relational database management system, Microsoft SQL Server will be required to support system functionality.
3.5.6	The system will use, where appropriate, the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO.   This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C#, MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server.
3.5.7	The system will make data available in standardized data formats such as tab-delimited text for use on users’ client systems including local installations of ARC GIS software or other off-line software applications.
3.6.0	Data will be subject to quality assurance prior to either initial or recurring uploading to STEWARDS. Initial population of STEWARDS will require that transition filters be developed jointly between the STEWARDS team and the individual watersheds. These filters will provide the same function for recurring, probably annual, uploads.
3.6.1.0	Local watershed staff will be responsible for performing necessary quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures prior to data being uploaded to the STEWARDS database.
3.6.1.1	Measurement methods and QA/QC procedures established by the CEAP Quality Assurance Team will be used by local data producers and recorded in  the data provided to STEWARDS.
3.6.2.0	Basic information regarding individual watersheds will be made available to STEWARDS by local watershed sites. Basic information may include spatial data in a GIS-compatible format; descriptive data about stations, instruments, methods, or procedures; reports; modeling results; and other data. Data will be reformatted to be compatible with the STEWARDS data schema and CEAP modeling requirements.
3.6.2.1	Watershed data to be used in modeling that does not conform to model requirements will be processed in STEWARDS for inclusion in the STEWARDS databases.
3.6.2.2	Protocols for data imports from local sites via input files with different formats will be developed and implemented jointly between the STEWARDS team and the local watersheds. The standard exchange file format will have been jointly determined first. A single import filter will be written to parse the standard formatted (e.g. tab-delimited) files from the local watershed sites. In this manner, all the data files from the local sites will have consistent formats when they are stored in the central site. The filter developed for the initial population of the database will be available for use in later periodic uploads.
3.6.3.0	Time-series data (measurement data, annual land use information, weather/climate data) and other data (spatial data, metadata) will be collected by local watershed staff, processed through local and CEAP QA/QC procedures, and uploaded to the STEW ARDS database on an annual basis using the filter developed during the initial population of the database.
3.6.3.1	Requests will initiate from the central system per schedule negotiated with individual watersheds.
3.6.3.2	Compliance by watershed staff is understood to be expected per obligations under CEAP watershed project plans revised to accommodate the CEAP project plan objective 1.
3.6.4.0	The central database will allow users to access the data of individual watersheds, sub-watersheds on a station-by-station basis, or a collection of stations if the entire data set is desired.
3.6.4.1	Multiple levels of data aggregation of time-series data (daily, monthly, or yearly) will be supported.
3.6.4.2	A great flexibility of export data should be also available in terms of data volume (the number of data entity and time coverage) and output format [for example, for tabular data – comma separated values (csv) or database format (dbf); for spatial data – shape file s (shp) or ascii grid file s (grd);
4.1.0	The user interface will be simple and consistent, using terminology commonly understood by the intended users of the system.  The system will have a simple interface, consistent with industry standard interfaces, to eliminate the need for user training of infrequent users.
4.1.1	The STEWARDS team will evaluate the user interface of similar systems and apply appropriately.  For additional details see Appendix E.
4.1.2	User testing will be used to ensure the user interface is clear (simple, commonly understood vocabulary, intuitive to use without training), complete (users can perform all functions from the interface), and consistent (buttons and wording are the same throughout the system).
4.2.1	No extra hardware interfaces are needed.  The system will use the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OC IO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hosting site, network server s, and network management tools.  This system will include a warning message when a low transmission speed is detected, and a non-graphical interface option will be available.
4.3.1	The system will use the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO.   This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C#, MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server.
4.4.1	The system will use the communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO.  This includes, but is not limited to, HTTP protocol for communication with the web browser and the web server and TCP/IP network protocol with HTTP protocol.
5.1.1	Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases.
5.1.1.1	Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less. Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.
5.1.1.2	If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met. In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.
5.1.2	Loading speed: The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in.
5.2.1	Data on the server should be protected from power loss but data in transit from server to requester could be lost. Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.
5.3.0	STEWARDS will have reasonable controls consistent with ARS OCIO practices, in compliance with agency, Dept and Govt regulations.  STEWARDS security requirements will have four primary components. They are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.3.1	STEWARDS will follow industry best practices  for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication. Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they  are.  This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated.  This is primarily done through userids and passwords.
5.3.2	Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately. STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate.   Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.
5.3.3	The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product.  Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system. Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process.  The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.
5.3.4	The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability.  The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not le ss than 50% of working hours in any week).  For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components. Intentional “denial of service attacks” is not foreseen as a significant concern.
5.4.1	This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.
5.4.2	Implementation of the application software/code and design of database structure should be flexible enough for the necessary change in the later phase.
5.4.3	Availability is defined here to mean the ability to use the system during its intended period of operation as defined in SCR-4 above.
6.1.1	GUI and dynamic web applications will be used as much as possible in the ARS data System.
6.1.2	Project-specific standards will be used to ensure consistency across the tools. The pages can  be viewed with Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator version 4.7, Netscape versions 6 and 7, and FireFox.1.0.
6.1.3	The pages will be designed for screen resolution of 800 x 600 pixels as a minimum.  Proper functionality of the application will require that cookies be enabled in the browser settings.
6.1.4	Arial font will be used across the tools.
6.2.1	Terminology used in the tools should be easily understandable by the user.
6.3.1	All pages performing similar functionality should have consistent Look & Feel.
6.3.2	Appropriate titles should be given to each page. The titles should specify the functionality of the page.
6.3.3	Appropriate alternate text should be provided for all the images, to help in navigation and better readability.
6.3.4	The title tag and the Meta description tag in the web pages will be carefully constructed to include the focused keywords so these keywords will be highly visible in the search engine results pages, making the STEWARDS product more useful to the general users after the public rollout.
6.4.1	Navigation facilities will be provided to navigate from one page to another page with minimum number of clicks.
6.5.1	Descriptive and user friendly messages for invalid input should be provided in all the pages. Completion/Confirmation messages should be displayed when the application processes the data successfully. Messages generated shall be clear, succinct, and free of jargon.
