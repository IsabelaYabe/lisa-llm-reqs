4.1.1	The MultiMahjongServer will be designed to reside on a central computer (server) that is connected to a TCP/IP network and has a unique IP address.
4.1.2	The MultiMahjongServer will allow connections from MultiMahjongClients and communicate with them using IP.

4.1.4	The MultiMahjongServer will automate the game initialisation functions (as opposed to the MultiMahjongClient doing them), such as: randomising tile order, randomising seating position and storing the "Game Info" database
4.1.5	The MultiMahjongServer will contain a High Scores list with the names and scores of the top MultiMahjong players.
4.1.6	The MultiMahjongServer will allow players on MultiMahjongClient programs to chat with each other in real time.
4.1.7	The MultiMahjongServer will allow players on MultiMahjongClient programs to modify their own names and icons during gameplay (as opposed to only at the beginning).

4.2.1	When the user begins the MultiMahjongClient program, they will be able to choose to create a new multi-player game, to create a new single player game, to join an existing multi player game, or to quit the program. These options will be available at any stage while the program is running as long as there is no game currently being played by the user
4.2.3	The MultiMahjongClient must send this game initialisation information to the MultiMahjongServer so that the MultiMahjongServer can create a new game.
4.2.4	The processing for any Computer Opponents (CO) will be done by the MultiMahjongClient program. In a single player game, the MultiMahjongClient will need to process for 3 COs. In a multi-player game with 2 human players, each MultiMahjongClient will support 1 CO. In a multiplayer game with 3 human players, only 1 of the 3 MultiMahjongClients will support a CO. Obviously, in a multi-player game with 4 human players, no CO is required.

If they choose to take this action, then the MultiMahjongClient must send this information to the MultiMahjongServer.
4.3.5	User's will be able to pick up a tile from the wall if it is their turn. If they choose to pick up, the MultiMahjongClient must send this information to the MultiMahjongServer.

4.4.1	The game will end when all 4 rounds have been played or if the user chooses to end the game.
4.4.2	The user will be able to end the game at any stage of the game. The user will then be able to quit the program or begin/join a new game.
4.4.3	The MultiMahjongServer will inform all MultiMahjongClients connected to the game that the game has ended. Users of any MultiMahjongClient previously connected to the game will have the choice to quit the program or to begin/join a new game.
4.4.4	If a user leaves the game prematurely, a new CO is created on another user's machine to fill their place. This CO will take over the user's current position and circumstance within the game. This CO will play at an ability level as defined in the Level 2 Requirements for the CO.
