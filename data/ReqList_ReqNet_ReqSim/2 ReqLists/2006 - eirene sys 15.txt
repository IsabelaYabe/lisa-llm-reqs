3.1.1	EIRENE mobiles are specified to conform to a common minimum standard of performance. It is the responsibility of national railways to design their EIRENE networks to provide the required level of service to EIRENE compliant mobiles.
3.1.2	This section draws together specifications and information related to the planning of an EIRENE network and provides guidance on target performance levels. Additional information on communication requirements for the ERTMS/ETCS application is provided in [ERTMS COMMS].
3.2.1	For network planning, the coverage level is defined as the field strength at the antenna on the roof of a train (nominally a height of 4m above the track). An isotropic antenna with a gain of 0dBi is assumed. This criterion will be met with a certain probability in the coverage area. (The target coverage power level is dependent on the statistical fluctuations caused by the actual propagation conditions.)
3.2.2	The following minimum values shall apply: coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 38.5 dBmV/m (-98 dBm) for voice and non-safety critical data; - coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 41.5 dBmV/m (-95 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds lower than or equal to 220km/h.
3.2.3	The following minimum values are recommended: - coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 44.5 dBmV/m (-92 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds above 280km/h; coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level between 41.5 dBmV/m and 44.5 dBmV/m (-95 dBm and –92 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds above 220km/h and lower than or equal to 280km/h.
3.2.4	The EIRENE mobile installation shall be designed to operate in a network meeting the criteria in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.
3.2.4.1	The specified coverage probability means that with a probability value of at least 95% in each location interval (length: 100m) the measured coverage level shall be greater than or equal to the figures stated above. The coverage levels specified above consider a maximum loss of 3 dB between antenna and receiver and an additional margin of 3 dB for other factors such as ageing.
3.2.4.2	The values for ETCS levels 2/3 concerning coverage and speed-limitations are to be validated and, if necessary, reviewed after the first operational implementation of ETCS.
3.3.1	The handover success rate should be at least 99.5% over train routes under design load conditions (as given in [EN 301 515, Index [30]]).
3.3.2	To avoid the necessity for large cell overlaps to accommodate high speed train operations, optimisation of the handover process for such trains is considered necessary. Suitable algorithms will be tested and refined as necessary during the trials process.
3.3.3	The proposed events for measurement of the start and stop of the handover execution at the mobile are: - receipt of ‘handover command’; - receipt of ‘UA’ after ‘physical info’ on new channel.
3.3.4	There is a quality of service requirement for handover executions (eg a break of 10s would clearly be unacceptable to the user). 300ms represents our current best estimate of the QoS figure, although this will need to be confirmed through user trials.
3.3.5	An additional option is available to reduce the handover break period, namely the use of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms. Synchronous handover requires the BTS transmissions in different cells to be synchronised by the system. Each authority can decide whether it wishes to use synchronised BTSs.
3.4.1	Call setup time requirement is dependent upon the eMLPP priority of a call [EN 301 515, Index [27]]. The required priority level for each call type is given in section 10.2.
3.4.2	Call setup times as defined in the EIRENE FRS shall be achieved with authentication and ciphering procedures enabled. Note: Authentication may be delayed if necessary to achieve the required call setup times.
3.4.3	In order to achieve these times the passage of the call through any networks external to GSM (eg from the GSM MSC to a controller linked by an ISDN connection) must take less than 250ms.
3.4.4	Achievement of fast call setup times requires information in the setup message to be compressed. A maximum of 12 digits may be sent as mobile originator-to-dispatcher information.
3.5.1	The network shall operate in a sub-band, or combination of sub-bands, of the R-GSM band as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]].
3.5.2	The UIC frequency band for GSM-R is defined in [CEPT 25-09], [1999/569/EC] and [ECC(02)05]: - 876 – 880 MHz (mobile station transmit); paired with - 921 – 925 MHz (base station transmit).
3.5.3	The carrier frequency is designated by the absolute radio frequency channel number (ARFCN), and is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]. For carriers in the UIC frequency band the following convention shall be used, where Fl(n) is the frequency value of the carrier ARFCN n in the lower band, and Fu(n) the corresponding frequency value in the upper band: - Fl(n) = 890 + 0.2*(n-1024),  955 <= n <= 973; - Fu(n) = Fl(n) + 45. Frequencies are in MHz.
3.6.1	The minimum duration of a DTMF tone and the length of pause between tones generated by the network (DTMF sender) and needed for the DTMF digit recognition in the network (DTMF receiver) are specified in [3G TS 23.014, Support of Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) signalling].
3.7.1	An entitled controller may terminate a VGCS/VBS call based on DTMF signalling [EN 301 515, Index [4] & [5]].
3.7.2	The network shall terminate the ongoing VGCS/VBS call if it receives the 3-digit sequence “***” transmitted via DTMF signals.
3.7.3	In order to minimise the discomfort caused by the DTMF tone added in the voice channel, the duration of the tone generated by the fixed line dispatcher shall be 70ms ± 5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone.
3.8.1	The muting and unmuting for VGCS shall be in line with [EN 301 515, Index [4]].
3.8.2	The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT = T”1 [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile station of the talking subscriber if it receives the 3-digit sequence “###” transmitted via DTMF or the group call SETUP message2 from a controller terminal. However, receiving the 3-digit sequence “###” or the group call SETUP message related to an additional controller while any other controller is talking shall not result in sending another SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT = T”.
3.8.3	When the network has detected the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###” transmitted via DTMF from a controller terminal and if the controller was not previously talking it should indicate its recognition by playing a single DTMF grant tone “#” of duration of 100ms ± 5ms to be sent to that controller terminal only.
3.8.4	The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT = F”3 [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile of the talking subscriber only if it has received the 3-digit sequence “#**” transmitted via DTMF from all the talking controllers4.
3.8.5	The duration of each tone (see 3.8.2 and 3.8.4) added in the voice channel, shall be 70ms ± 5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone.
4.1.1	To ensure interoperability, all EIRENE mobiles are specified with a common level of basic services, facilities and features. This section of the specification gives details of these core requirements, while sections 5-7 detail requirements specific to each of the radio types.
4.1.2	The logical architecture of an EIRENE mobile station (EIRENE MS) is shown in figure 4-1. The architecture consists of the following elements: a) GSM Mobile Termination (GSM-MT): comprising GSM mobile equipment and SIM; b)  Direct Mode Mobile Termination (DM-MT): for direct mode communications; c)  EIRENE applications: standardised features outside GSM: dependent on radio type; d)  Man Machine Interface (MMI): dependent on radio type.
4.1.3	The logical architecture comprises a number of interfaces between the different EIRENE-MS elements. These are: 1) GSM-MT air interface: mandatory for interoperability and conformant to GSM specifications; 2) DM-MT air interface: Direct Mode is optional. However, where implemented, the requirements concerning this interface are mandatory for interoperability; 3) GSM-MT - EIRENE Applications interface: specified to allow an option for separate procurement of GSM-MT and EIRENE Application equipment for the Cab radio (see [MORANE FFFIS MTI]);  4) DM-MT - EIRENE Applications interface: specified to allow an option for separate procurement of DM-MT and EIRENE Application equipment for the Cab radio; 5) EIRENE Applications - MMI interface: not specified.

4.3.5.1	For this, the higher layers of an EIRENE radio shall automatically repeat setup requests to the layer 3 GCC or BCC entity as soon as an indication is given from the layer 3 GCC or BCC entity on an abort of the establishment procedure without the service being explicitly rejected by the network. No change of the related layer 3 procedures of GSM is intended.

8.3.5	The duration of each tone (see 8.3.2 and 8.3.4) added in the voice channel, shall be 70ms ± 5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone.
9.1.1	International standardisation of the numbering plan is required to ensure interworking between networks. Furthermore, standardised allocation of numbers to subscribers is likely to facilitate schemes for identification, barring etc.
9.1.2	This section addresses the following: - numbering plan requirements; - numbering plan limitations; - types of numbers; - EIRENE numbering plan; - short dialling codes; - group addresses.
9.1.3	The precise details of the numbering plan to be chosen for particular railways will depend upon the railway network configuration, its interconnection with other railway networks and its interconnection with public telecommunication networks. Equipment design must therefore be such as to give maximum flexibility in numbering arrangements. However, it may be generally assumed that numbers (excluding access prefixes) will not exceed 15 digits in length and will consist entirely of the digits 1 to 9 and 0.
9.1.4	Characters * and # may be used locally to gain access to special facilities such as short code dialling. However, these arrangements do not form part of the network numbering plan.
9.1.5	Procedures for handling the relationship between EIRENE Numbers and MSISDN numbers (ie registration, deregistration and re-registration) are specified in section 11.
9.1.6	Each railway should have appropriate call-barring facilities to prevent unintended access to the GSM-R network by non-authorised users.
9.2.1	Within each GSM-R network, each Train Number shall be unique for the period of the journey.
9.2.2	Every On-Train Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to the list of functions given in Appendix 9A of this section.
9.2.3	All Train Function Numbers and their associated MSISDN numbers shall be stored in the same routing database, which is the database of the GSM-R network in which the train is currently operating.
9.2.4	Every On-Engine Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to the list of functions given in Appendix 9A of this section.
9.2.5	The Engine Function Number(s) and associated MSISDN numbers shall at any time be stored as an entry in the routing database of the home GSM-R network6 of the engine.
9.2.6	The Coach Function Number(s) and associated MSISDN number(s) shall at any time be stored as an entry in the routing database of the home GSM-R network of the coach.
9.2.7	Every Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to the list of functions given in Appendix 9A of this section.
9.2.8	The functional numbers of the Shunting Team Members, Maintenance Team Members and Train Controller (and any associated MSISDN numbers) shall be stored as entries in the routing database of the home GSM-R network.
9.2.9	Implementation of the EIRENE numbering plan shall not prohibit any authorised caller from using the MSISDN number where known, thus enabling mobiles to be assigned to particular personnel where this is appropriate.
9.2.10	Service areas shall be defined within each railway network.
9.2.11	The numbering of Service Areas for group calls and broadcast calls shall be made in accordance with GSM Technical Specifications [EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]] and [EN 301 515, Index [22] & [5]] respectively.
9.3.1	The EIRENE network can not be considered as a fully private network, as some parts of either the mobile or fixed networks may be provided by public operators. This leads to certain restrictions on the implementation of a numbering plan. These restrictions are given below.
9.3.2	To achieve integration of the EIRENE numbering plan with the national public numbering plan, telephone numbers have to be allocated by the various numbering regulatory bodies on a national basis. If functional numbers are to be used outside the EIRENE network, they will require either a public number allocation or, alternatively, an EIRENE Network Access Number (ENAN) may be used as described in 9.11
9.3.3	Each national railway should obtain a public numbering allocation for MSISDN numbers from the relevant regulatory bodies.
9.3.4	The EIRENE numbering plan shall be standardised to allow interoperability and shall be implemented as a private numbering plan within the GSM-R network.
9.3.5	In some countries Train Numbers are alphanumeric. These numbers do not comply with a numbering plan that can be interpreted by telephone switches and are therefore not supported by the call routing solution given in section 11.
9.3.6	If alphanumerical numbering is required within a railway network, then these numbers may either be translated at the user terminal into a subscriber number or conveyed between the calling party and a routing database using a nationally determined approach.
9.4.1	Within the GSM-R network, the user shall be able to dial the following types of numbers: - National EIRENE Number (NEN): this number is used to route a call from the calling party to a called party registered within the same GSM-R network; - International EIRENE Number (IEN): this number is used to route a call from the calling party to a called party registered within another GSM-R network; - MSISDN numbers: the number used by a subscriber of a public fixed (or mobile) network for calling a mobile station of a GSM PLMN; - Short Dialling Code (SDC): this number is used to allow ’speed dialling’ functionality.
9.4.2	In addition, Breakout Codes (BCs) shall be used to allow users within the GSM-R network to access external numbers.
9.4.3	Access from the GSM-R network to external networks shall be as detailed in section
9.5.1	National EIRENE Numbers are used to set up calls within a single GSM-R network.
9.5.2	Every railway network shall consider a number as a National EIRENE Number (NEN) unless the number is preceded by an International Code, identifying another GSM-R network.
9.5.3.1	The Call Type (CT) prefix is used to distinguish between the different types of User Numbers that are allowed within the national EIRENE numbering plan. It is an indication to the network of how to interpret the number dialled.
9.5.3.2	The User Identifier Number (UIN) shall be one of the following numbers (as identified by the CT): - Train Number (TN): a number given to a train by operational staff for a particular journey. This number shall be unique for the duration of the journey. - For certain Train Numbers (e.g. 1234 and 123), a risk exists when dialling a number by keying in individual digits e.g. by the dispatcher. In this circumstance the risk of connecting to an un-intended train exists if there is a delay between keyed-in digits.  There is no risk of ambiguity if block dialling is employed. - Engine Number (EN): a unique number given to a tractive unit to identify it permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform identification marking system for tractive stock crossing frontiers [UIC 438-3]. In order to call a particular locomotive, it shall be possible to call a number associated with the tractive unit's stock number. The actual number of the unit, which shall be used as the EN, is based on the complete identification number. - Coach Number (CN): a unique number given to a coach (which is not a tractive unit) to identify it permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform identification marking for passenger rolling stock [UIC 438-1]. In order to call a particular coach it shall be possible to call a number associated with the vehicle marking. The total vehicle marking consists of 12 digits. The actual number of the coach is denoted by seven digits (positions 5 to 11 of the complete vehicle marking), which shall be used as the CN7. - Shunting Team Location Number (STLN) - Maintenance Team Location Number (MTLN) - Train Controller Location Number (TCLN) - Group Location Number (GLN) - Mobile Subscriber Number (MSN) 3) Function Code: The Function Code (FC) is used as an identification of, for example, the person or equipment on a particular train, or a particular team within a given area.
9.5.4	The contents of the fields of a National EIRENE Number shall be as defined below:
9.5.4.1	This prefix defines how to interpret the User Number that follows. It shall consist of one or two digits as defined in table 9-1.
9.5.4.2	The UN is variable in length and depends on the information on which it is based. The following formats are defined: - Train Function Numbers (TFN) shall take one of the forms as defined in table 9-2.

The Location Number shall consist of 5 digits and shall be assigned on a national basis. The Function Code shall consist of 4 digits. The first digit of the FC is related to the Team Type (TT) and is specified by table 9-5.
9.5.4.6	The composition of the Function Code field for calls to shunting teams and maintenance teams shall be as defined in table 9-6.

9.5.4.8	The UN of the MSN shall consist of the Subscriber Number.
9.5.4.9	The UIN field format for group calls shall be a Service Area (SA) indicator, which identifies the area in which the group call is to be active. Each Service Area shall be allocated on a national basis. In network boundary areas, the Service Area shall be allocated on a bilateral basis. (See also subsection 9.9.)
9.5.4.10	The FC field format for group calls shall consist of three digits and be as defined in table 9-8.
9.6.2	GSM-R networks shall recognise International EIRENE Numbers starting with the IC of the GSM-R network in which the calling party is currently operating as National EIRENE Numbers.
9.6.3	The International EIRENE Number shall consist of three distinct parts, as shown in figure 9-2: - International Code (IC), which shall be used to route calls to the appropriate GSM-R network; - National EIRENE Number (NEN), which consists of the combination of Call Type and User Number and which is used to identify the called party.
9.6.4	The fields of an International Functional Number shall be defined as follows: 1) International Code (IC): The International Code field shall consist of three digits and shall be based on the [ITU-T E.164] country code (XCC or CCC), allocated by the UIC on a network-by-network basis. 2) National EIRENE Number (NEN): The format of the National EIRENE Number field shall be as defined in subsection 9.5.
9.7.1	At least one MSISDN number shall be allocated to each mobile station.
9.7.2	The structure of the MSISDN numbers shall comply with GSM Technical Specification [GSM 03.03].
9.7.3	Within each GSM-R network, the following relationships between the MSISDN Subscriber Number and the National EIRENE Number can be identified: - the MSISDN Subscriber Number shall be equal to the National EIRENE Number for Call Type = 8; - the MSISDN number may be equal to the National EIRENE Number for any other Call Type.
9.7.4	It shall be possible for authorised subscribers of fixed and mobile networks to call mobiles using the appropriate MSISDN number.
9.8.1	For certain functions, standardised short codes shall be implemented for mobile originated calls.
9.8.2	Each short dialling code shall consist of four digits.
9.8.3	Short dialling codes shall start with the first digit equal to 1 (ie CT=1).
9.8.4	The short dialling codes can be defined on a national basis, but it is essential that certain codes be used on an international basis in order to achieve interoperability. These codes shall be as given in table 9-10.
9.8.5	In addition, the network shall support the special short codes as defined in table 9-11.
9.9.1	Standardisation of UIC group addresses is required to provide interoperability between the fixed railway networks within the GSM-R network.
9.9.2	The group address consists of a Service Area (5 digits) and a Function Code (3 digits) and has a Call Type 5 (see table 9-1).
9.9.3	The Service Area shall be defined on a national basis.
9.9.4	In network boundary areas, the Service Area shall be allocated on a bilateral basis.
9.9.5	Function Codes shall be defined within the framework given in table 9-8 on an international basis.
9.10.1	Access to other GSM-R networks shall be possible by using a Breakout Code (BC) as part of the dialled number.
9.10.1.1	Access to other GSM-R networks may be possible by using an Access Code (AC) as part of the dialled number if the NSN (National Significant Number) following the CC (Country Code) is assigned by the national telecommunication regulator to the GSM-R operator.
9.10.1.2	The BC for access to other GSM-R networks is defined in table 9-12a, and is followed by the full international EIRENE number of the called party.
9.10.1.3	The AC for access to other GSM-R networks is defined in table 9-12b, and is followed by the CC + NDC + SN of the other GSM-R network. The number format complies with [ITU-T 164].
9.10.1.4	It is the responsibility of each individual GSM-R operator to acquire a public domain NDC from their national telecommunications regulator.
9.10.1.5	Access to private networks shall be performed by using a BC, defined in table 9-12c.
9.10.2	The GSM-R network shall allow users direct access to public networks, subject to call barring restrictions.
9.10.3	Where access to public networks is allowed, this shall be performed by using an Access Code (AC), defined in table 9-13, followed by the international or national number of the called subscriber as defined in [ITU-T 164].
9.11.1	Access to the GSM-R network should be performed by dialling an EIRENE Network Access Number (ENAN)8, followed by the relevant National or International Functional Number as defined in subsections 9.5 and 9.6 respectively.
9.11.2	Provision should be made to prevent unauthorised calls to mobiles from outside the GSM-R network.
10.3.2	Access classes should not be used under normal network operating conditions, where the GSM eMLPP may be used to provide a better grade of service to certain users.
10.3.3	For consistent working on public networks and in international roaming, the use of access classes in a railway network shall comply with the GSM specification.
10.3.4	If special access classes (eg 12 - 14) are assigned within a railway’s network to certain high priority users, it ought to be noted that when roaming, this will only have an effect on a national public network, subject to bilateral agreement.
10.4.1	Closed User Groups (CUGs) may be employed by railways as an additional security measure. Such facilities may be particularly important if public network access to the radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of the public calling drivers and drivers calling members of the public).
10.4.2	Any implementation of CUGs must take account of requirements for interoperability.
10.5.1	SIM cards shall contain a list of authorised networks so that networks shall be displayed (or automatically selected if automatic network selection has been enabled) in the following order of priority (see [MORANE SIM] for more details): - home EIRENE network; - ‘foreign’ EIRENE networks; - non-EIRENE networks (with order of priority predetermined by virtue of international subscriptions and roaming agreements).
10.5.1.1	In order to shorten the duration of the network selection procedure, Mobile Stations designed for use in EIRENE networks shall give preference to the GSM frequency band allocated for railway use (see 3.5.2).
10.5.2	The use of “Over The Air” in conjunction with the SIM Application Toolkit [EN 301 515, Index [36]] to update SIM cards in the home network is recommended (see [MORANE SIM] for more details).
10.6.1	Railway mobiles shall be provided with cell broadcast message identifiers in order to accept SMS-CB messages.
10.7.1	Encryption. Licensing of A5/x encryption algorithms is managed by the GSM Association.
10.7.1.1	In case of encryption, standardised ciphering algorithms shall be used.
10.7.3	Mobiles shall be capable of operation using algorithms for all countries in which they need to roam.
10.7.4	Authentication. Each railway is free to implement its own authentication algorithms without any resulting loss in cross-border interoperability.
11.1.1	There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a ‘functional number’ rather than a more permanent subscriber number. Such numbers are generally only associated with a user for a limited period of time.
11.1.2	This is an important issue which will affect interoperability and the ability to use public network services. There are specific features of individual railways which make it difficult to develop a concise and universally acceptable system within GSM.
11.1.3	To accommodate the different requirements of the individual railways, the following approach has been adopted: - all responsibility for handling addressing lies with the network infrastructure and other ground based equipment, rather than additional functionality in the mobile; - each railway will be responsible for implementing addressing schemes which best meet its needs; - national addressing schemes are to use the internationally standardised ground-train protocol, based on a single standardised GSM service, for exchanging information between the ground and mobiles.
11.2.1	The ground-train addressing can be divided into two areas: - functional addressing of mobile users; - location dependent addressing of fixed network users.
11.2.2	The first is related to passing information to provide an association between a mobile’s subscriber number and its functional number. The latter is concerned with ensuring that calls from a mobile terminal (in particular, Cab radios) are routed to the correct destination (ie primary controller, secondary controller), based on the current location of the mobile.
11.2.3	The numbering plan to be used with functional addressing shall be in accordance with the numbering plan given in section 9.
11.3.1	Functional numbering provides the mechanism by which a mobile terminal, or an item of equipment connected to a mobile terminal, can be addressed by a number identifying the function for which it is being used.
11.3.2	Mobile access to the functional numbering scheme for registration, deregistration and re-registration shall apply the USSD messages and protocols over the air interface as specified in the GSM Follow-me service.
11.3.3	The implementation of functional numbering at a network level is left open for national railways subject to the requirements for interconnecting EIRENE networks identified in section 11.6.
11.3.4	Further information may be obtained from [MORANE SSRS, MORANE FA FFFS, MORANE FA FIS].
11.3.5	For communication over the (Um) air interface, the USSD messages and protocols as specified in the GSM Follow-me service shall be used to manage the following types of functional numbers: - Train number; - Engine number; - Coach number; - Shunting team number; - Maintenance team number.
11.3.6	It shall be possible to limit user access to functional number registration and deregistration facilities based on each of the types of functional number identified in 11.3.5.
11.3.8	The network operator shall implement the required functionality to validate the information exchanged between the mobile and network on registration and deregistration.
11.3.8.1	Functionality shall be provided by the system for the operator management of Functional Numbers, including the removal of the relationship between Functional Numbers and MSISDN Numbers.
11.3.8.2	The use of the forced de-registration mechanism (without notification) to achieve this requirement is acceptable.
11.3.8.3	The system shall require manual confirmation prior to the removal of the relationship between Engine Number and MSISDN Number.
11.3.9	The result of the registration procedure shall be sent back to the mobile. In the event of a failure, an indication of the cause shall be provided. Information on the outcome shall be provided to the mobile according to [EN 301 515, Index [17]] and [EN 301 515, Index [34]].
11.3.9.1	In the event of a registration procedure failing owing to the functional number already being registered to another mobile, the Cab radio shall be capable of providing the user with the ability to perform automatically the forced de-registration of the previously registered mobile and the registration of this functional number to the user’s mobile. This shall result in the following sequence of actions being performed by the user’s Cab radio (see 11.3.7 for details of message structure): 1. Send interrogation message (from mobile to network). 2. Receive MSISDN (from network to mobile). 3. Send a forced de-registration message (from mobile to network). 4. Receive the answer (from network to mobile). 5. Send a registration message (from mobile to network). 6. Receive the answer (from network to mobile). 7. Inform the user whether the registration of the functional number to the user’s mobile was successful (performed by the mobile).
11.3.9.2	The functionality described in 11.3.9i should also be available for other types of mobiles.
11.3.9.3	In the cases described in 11.3.9i and 11.3.9ii, national rules may dictate that, prior to or instead of performing the sequence described in 11.3.9i steps 1-7, the user shall perform a specified action (e.g. call a dispatcher in the case of drivers).
11.3.9.4	The sequence described in 11.3.9i steps 1-7 may be interrupted or may require additional user action such as a confirmation.
11.3.10	Deregistration shall only be performed by the subscription identified by the MSISDN number which is associated with the functional number.
11.3.12	The result of the deregistration procedure shall be sent back to the mobile. In the event of a failure, an indication of the cause shall be provided. Information on the outcome shall be provided to the mobile according to [EN 301 515, Index [17]] and [EN 301 515, Index [34]].
11.3.13	Re-registration consists of a registration procedure followed by a deregistration procedure.
11.3.14	Re-registration of on-train functional numbers based on the train number shall be performed every time a train leaves one EIRENE network and enters into another EIRENE network.
11.3.15	Deregistration of a functional number shall not be carried out until registration of the functional number has been carried out and confirmed as being successful.
11.3.16	Each railway should define a suitable time-out interval to be applied as part of the deregistration procedure for on-train functional numbers.
11.3.17	The exchange of information between EIRENE networks is handled by the GMSCs and shall use the standardised protocol as detailed in section 11.6.
11.4.1	In the event of losing correlation between functional numbers and MSISDNs, provision for recovery from such a situation shall be made.
11.4.2	Each national railway is responsible for implementing a suitable recovery mechanism and ensuring that the use of unverified functional numbers is prevented.
11.5.1	The called party functional identity shall be presented to the user initiating a call and the calling party functional identity shall be presented to the user receiving a call.
11.5.2	The calling party functional number shall be passed to the receiving mobile using the User to User Signalling supplementary service (UUS1) during call setup.
11.5.3	If the calling party functional number is not available or if the calling party is not registered then the CLI of the calling party shall be displayed on the receiving mobile's display.
11.5.4	The user-to-user information element in the SETUP, ALERT or CONNECT messages, as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [16]], shall be used to transfer the functional number of the calling party to the called party.
11.6.1	Interconnection of EIRENE networks is required to allow international call routing. It is not envisaged that any routing database information is exchanged between EIRENE networks.
11.6.2	The interconnection of EIRENE networks should take place by interconnecting GMSCs.
11.6.3	The protocol used for routing of calls shall be Signalling System No 7 (SS7) as defined by the ITU-T. The signalling system suite shall include the Mobile Application Part (MAP).
11.6.4	Call setup between EIRENE networks using international functional numbers shall be based on the combination of the Breakout-Code (BC) and International Code (IC) as specified in section 9.
11.6.5	The Country Code (CC) followed by the National Significant Number NSN (as specified in ITU-T E.164, Chapter 6.2) shall be used as the Global Title, which forms part of the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) protocol messages and is used for inter-network routing of messages.
11.7.1	Location dependent addressing may be provided in the following ways: a) cell dependent routing; b) using location information from external sources.
11.7.2	As a minimum, call routing using location dependent addressing shall be based on the use of short codes in conjunction with cell dependent routing.
11.7.3	Further information on cell dependent routing for location dependent addressing may be obtained from [MORANE SSRS] [MORANE LDA FFFS] [MORANE LDA FIS].
11.7.4	Location information may be provided by systems external to the radio system, for example ground-based systems such as track circuits.

11.8.1	Facilities shall be provided to prevent unauthorised calls to mobiles either by functional number or MSISDN number from outside the EIRENE network.
12.1.1	There is no requirement for an internationally standardised pre-defined messaging application. However, it is anticipated that individual national railways may have a requirement for pre-defined messages, in which case the application will be specified as part of individual national procurements.
12.2.1	Where text messaging is implemented in the network, the Short Message Service (SMS) shall be used. (M) 12 Text messaging
13.1.2	A Railway emergency call is a high priority call for informing drivers, controllers and other concerned personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railway movements in a pre-defined area to stop. Two types of Railway emergency calls are defined: - Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting operations); - Shunting emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst involved in Shunting operations).
13.1.3	This section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for Railway operational emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls (ie handling of ‘112’ calls).
13.2.1	Railway emergency calls are defined as those calls of ‘Railway emergency’ priority (see section 10) which are routed to a pre-defined user or group of users due to a railway operational emergency.
13.2.2	All Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using GSM VGCS (Specifications [EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]]).
13.2.3	It shall be possible to configure Railway emergency group call areas to contain combinations of cells controlled by one or more MSC(s) within one or more network(s).
13.2.4	Where Railway emergency group call areas are controlled by more than one MSC within one or more network(s), a unique anchor MSC is defined for each group call area.
13.2.5	For international Railway emergency calls, in order to minimise call set-up times, it is recommended that the anchor MSC always directly controls the cell where the Railway emergency call was originated.
13.3.1	A Railway emergency call shall be initiated by using the appropriate function code for the required type of Railway emergency call (see Table 9-8).
13.3.2	The call area and list of train controllers for each emergency group call will be fixed in the Group Call Register (GCR) of the anchor MSC.
13.3.3	The Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability are defined in section 9.5. The composition of each group is a matter for national implementation, although all areas shall have a group defined for all mandated Group IDs.
13.4.1	Each mobile shall store a list of emergency Group IDs in the SIM appropriate to its function (the Cab radio will store Group ID 299 and 599 - see table 9-8).
13.4.2	All Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability and appropriate to the operation of the mobile shall maintain active status whilst the mobile is powered up.
13.4.3	The fixed network user will only receive emergency voice calls if designated a dispatcher or group member in any of the calls defined in the GSM GCR.
13.4.4	On receipt of a Railway emergency call, the controller’s display should indicate the location of the train.
13.4.5	If the requirement in 13.4.4 is implemented, as a minimum the location information shall be provided by the GSM network (eg current cell or base station serving the mobile).
13.4.6	The mechanism for transferring the functional number of the originating mobile to controllers is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [6], Release 4] using the Information Element “Compressed OTDI” in the Immediate Setup 2 message from the originating mobile.
13.4.7	If the GSM Release 99 capability and the Immediate Setup 2 feature defined in [EN 301 515, Index [6], Release 4] are supported by the network, the network shall set the MSC Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information element to “1”. Otherwise, the MSC Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information element shall be set to “0” (zero) [EN 301 515, Index [41]].
13.5.1	For post-incident analysis it is important that the initiation and receipt of Railway emergency calls by mobiles is confirmed by a message sent to a ground-based location (and also registered in the train borne recorder, in cases where a train borne recorder is connected to the Cab radio).
13.5.2	Not all calls require confirmation. The application must be able to deduce that a confirmation is necessary from the call priority, as all calls of ‘Railway emergency’ priority must be confirmed.
13.5.3	Confirmation of Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using the User to User Signalling supplementary service (UUS1).
13.5.4	After clear down of the Railway Emergency call, the mobile application shall start the confirmation process by automatically originating a call. In order to avoid network congestion the call set up shall be delayed by a random offset.
13.5.5	Railway Emergency call confirmation messages shall be of eMLPP priority 4 - “Railway information and all other calls” (see section 10.2).
13.5.6	The user information contained in the confirmation message shall be: - Cab radio: the engine number or train number (if registered); - other mobiles: the user’s functional number (if registered).
13.5.7	Confirmation messages shall be sent to a confirmation centre using a defined short code (see table 9-10), which shall be associated with the GSM network.
13.5.8	In the case of Cab radio, details of the confirmation shall be passed to the train borne recorder if a train borne recorder is connected to the Cab radio.
13.5.9	The user-to-user information elements in the following messages, as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [16]], shall be used for the confirmation of high priority calls: - SETUP: transfer of confirmation message to confirmation centre; - RELEASE COMPLETE: acknowledgement of the confirmation message.
13.5.10	The SETUP and RELEASE COMPLETE user-to-user information element shall be as specified in the [MORANE UUIE].
13.5.10.1	Confirmation centres shall be capable of decoding messages in either format A or B.
14.1.1	The purpose of shunting mode is to provide an effective means of communication to a group of personnel who are involved with a shunting operation.
14.1.2	The shunting group may comprise a shunting leader, a shunting driver, a controller and up to three additional personnel (the shunting members).
14.2.1	On entering shunting mode, the operational radio shall determine if any shunting group ID is already activated on the SIM.
14.2.2	If a shunting group ID is activated, the operational radio shall proceed to re-establish the group call.
14.2.3	If no shunting group ID is activated, the operational radio shall initiate a “regular shunting mode ON” procedure as detailed in table 14-1.
14.2.4	After the “regular shunting mode ON” procedure has been completed, the procedures shown in table 14-2 and 14-3 shall be used to register the shunting leader and shunting members to a dedicated group call.
14.2.5	Two possibilities shall be available to the shunting leader when leaving shunting mode: - Release group call: the shunting leader and all other shunting members leave the dedicated group call and all members of the group are deregistered. The procedure that shall be used to release the group call is shown in table 14-4. - Maintain group call: the shunting leader leaves the dedicated group call momentarily for the purposes of conducting other communications. The leader may then rejoin the group when ready. In the meantime, all other shunting team members remain active within the dedicated group call. The operational radio procedure that shall be used to maintain the group call is shown in table 14-5.
14.2.6	On leaving shunting mode, the Operational radios of shunting members shall follow the procedure shown in table 14-6.
14.3.1	On entering shunting mode, the Cab radio shall determine if any shunting group ID is already activated on the SIM.
14.3.2	If a shunting group ID is activated, the Cab radio shall proceed to re-establish the group call.
14.3.3	If no shunting group ID is activated, the Cab radio shall initiate a “regular shunting mode ON” procedure as shown in table 14-7.
14.3.4	The Cab radio shall exit shunting mode by means of the “Leave shunting mode” procedure as defined in table 14-8.
14.4.1	On entering shunting mode, the terminal shall initially select the common shunting group.
14.4.2	The common shunting group provides a point of contact for leaders and team members to set up a dedicated shunting group call for their shunting operation.
14.4.3	The terminal application shall prevent members of a dedicated shunting team from initiating a new call (unless they are registered as shunting team leader and have left shunting mode using the “maintain group call” function described in 14.2.4).
14.6.1	Users shall be prevented from joining a dedicated shunting group by the EIRENE terminal application unless a valid functional number for the group has been successfully registered to the GSM-R network by their terminal.
14.7.2	The link assurance tone shall be of the form specified in subsection 14.4.2 of the [EIRENE FRS].
14.7.3	The mechanism for the generation of the link assurance signal shall be as specified in [MORANE SM FFFIS].
14.7.5	The mechanism for the deactivation of the link assurance signal shall be as specified in [MORANE SM FFFIS].
15.1.1	The operational requirement for direct mode is to: 1) provide short range fall-back communications between train drivers and trackside personnel in the event of failure of all railway and/or public GSM services normally available; 2) provide short range communications for railway personnel operating in remote areas where no GSM facilities are available.
15.2.1	Implementation of direct mode is optional. However, where implemented, the following requirements shall be mandatory.
15.2.2	Frequency modulated equipment conforming to [ETS 300 086] shall be used for direct mode.
15.2.3	Direct mode equipment shall have a maximum transmit power of 1 Watt.
15.2.4	Direct mode equipment sensitivity shall be at least –107dBm.
15.2.5	Direct mode equipment shall be capable of operation in the channels defined in table 15-1.
15.2.6	Direct mode shall operate in simplex mode, a radio link that uses a single frequency for alternate transmission and reception.
15.2.7	Voice transmission from direct mode equipment shall be possible only when the Push-To-Talk (PTT) button is pressed.
15.2.8	Continuous Tone Coded Squelch Systems (CTCSS) shall be implemented on all direct mode equipment.
15.2.9	The CTCSS tone shall be at a frequency of 203.5 Hz.
15.2.10	The CTCSS modulation shall be within the limits defined in table 15-2.
15.2.11	The purpose of the common access channel is to provide a point of contact and information for all direct mode users. For example, if one direct mode user wished to initiate contact with another user, communication would begin with a request for the desired partner on the access channel. After receiving a reply, both parties may transfer to a free direct mode channel and continue.
15.2.12	Direct mode channel 1 (876.0125 MHz) shall serve as the common access channel.
15.2.13	Equipment should default to operation on the common access channel (direct mode channel 1) on entry into direct mode.
15.2.14	Direct mode communications will only be used in the event of normal GSM-R services being unavailable.
15.2.15	The presence of the GSM-R network shall be indicated to direct mode users.
15.2.16	All terminals shall ensure that when GSM-R services are available, the user is prevented from entering direct mode.
15.2.17	In the event of GSM-R causing disruption to ongoing direct mode communications, each railway will define a protocol for re-establishing contact by means of GSM-R.
15.2.18	All direct mode equipment shall provide the facility to broadcast an in-band audio shunting link assurance signal as defined in subsection 14.4.2 of the [EIRENE FRS].
