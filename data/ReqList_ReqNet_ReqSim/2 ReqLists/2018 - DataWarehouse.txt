5.1.1.1.1	Wherever Sentinel data can be used to fulfil the requirements expressed in this document , they should be considered with priority.  In view of budgetary limitations, some requirements may need a progressive phase -in with the availability of Sentinel data fulfilling these needs.
5.1.1.2.1	When the licenses on satellite datasets need to be procured, the datasets must remain accessible as archives for future use by users benefiting from the rights attached to the DWH license .
5.2.1.1.1	The provision of datasets shall support a seamless transition when satellite missions supporting the data provision are replaced by new ones, as far as technically possible. The data provision scheme shall thus support the parallel provision of data from the old and the new missions for the duration necessary to allow cross calibration and comparability of datasets (as far as the implication on the budget distribution is reasonable).
5.2.1.2.1	During each acquisition campaign the dataset characteristics of procured data shall not be modified unilaterally by the data providers.
5.2.1.3.1	CCME data shall be delivered in standard formats; with complete and validated INSPIRE compliant metadata. The datasets shall be identified according to a standard file naming convention.
5.2.1.3.2	A single, common harmonized format should be considered for the delivery of individual files used to provide wall -to-wall coverage of an AOI from different missions.
5.3.1.1.1	Each optical CORE dataset shall be provided as a set of individual images (scenes) with separated spectral bands at pixel value (bundled with other products if requested or offered) to allow for the maximum level of flexibility in automated classification and visual interpretations, including future developments.
5.3.1.2.1	The delivery of each individual file in a dataset shall be provided in a single, common harmonised format for level 2 and 3 products. From the start of the operational delivery of Sentinel -2 data, the delivery of CCME level 2 and 3 products shall meet a standard file format  and structure  with complete nd validated INSPIRE compliant  metadata , and according to the standard file naming convention ( see Annex 2 ).
5.3.1.2.2	The general aim of the harmonisation of file structure, metadata and naming shall be to facilitate automation of the retrieval and processing of the datasets, as much as possible on a common basis.
5.3.1.2.3	Furthermore, from the start of the operational delivery of Sentinel -2 data, each dataset shall be accompanied by a data quality layer, encoded according to the specifications in Annex 7 .
5.3.1.3.1	The acquisition campaigns shall be repeated every 3 years taking the year 2012 as starting reference year (n -3). To ensure the full coverage of the area of interest (AOI), the acquisition campaign shall start the year before (n-1). The overall objective shall be to acquire full coverage of the AOI within the first 2 years. The year after (n+1) may be used for remaining gap-filling. Adjustment must be made to make optimal use of available SWIR sensors in particular in 2014.
5.3.1.4.1	For procured optical imagery,  a common and consistent way of delineating and encoding Cloud Coverage and Cloud shadows  shall be  put in place, taking  into account the cloud fringe areas and treat separately the indication of cloud shadow areas  and the presence of haze  in order to allow  automatic processing of the data . Guidelines on how to identify typical C loud Coverage  issues are made available in Annex 9 .
5.3.1.5.1	To ensure an adequate management of each step in the full workflow of acquisition campa ign, pre -processing and information production over large territories and involving multiple stakeholder groups, it is mandatory to maintain the status of all key steps in the full cycle in a single master shape -file, constantly updated during the full cycle of any acquisition campaign (yearly basis) with key attributes, allowing all to have access to the same comprehensive status overview.
5.3.1.5.2	The acquired scenes shall be referred to in a master shape -file of the EEA39 countries in LAEA ETRS89 (EPSG code 3035)  as background layer, and comprising layers on a per -sensor and per -year basis.  Each layer shall contain ALL scene footprints taken into consideration for programming the acquisitions (each scene being the smallest spatial object).
5.3.1.5.3	Separate layers shall be added for gap -filling through archive retrieval and/or extensions to other sensors.
5.3.1.5.4	Each footprint shall have as minimum the following list of attributes:  • Identification of the scene; • Date of acquisition ; • Status of pre -processing ; • Encoding of cloud cover ; • Encoding of haze ; • Encoding of technical quality of image ; • Availability in the data warehouse ; • Acceptation/rejection .
5.3.1.5.5	Attributes shall be encoded in a semantically standardised structure, thus allowing easy search, selection, filtering and combination queries in order to facilitate management of the actual status of acquisitions.
5.3.1.5.6	The master shape-file shall be managed by ESA, and constantly updated during the acquisition campaign by the CCMEs.  The master -file shall be accessible for all stakeholders in the process through a point of access facility  ensuring that all partners at any point of time are dealing with the same information content.
5.3.1.6.1	For all wall -to-wall optical CORE dataset acquisition campaigns, in order to maximise the chances of successful coverage matching the acquisition requirements, a new remuneration mechanism shall be applied. Simple per -scene remuneration has shown not to be appropriate. Therefore, a scheme shall be put in place, which, while encouraging data providers to acquire and deliver as much images as possible, will reward them in the end according to the quality of the best possible coverage accomplished.
5.3.1.6.2	At the end of the acquisition campaign for any year, the data providers (CCMEs)  shall propose a mosaic composed of all scenes they consider matching the acquisition specifications, for assessing the quality parameters, which will determine the final price.
5.3.1.6.3	A total of five quality indicators will be evaluated based on the final mosaic:  • Total coverage achieved;  • Number of scenes required;  • Average size of all areas composed of contiguously connected scenes;  • Max size of the largest data gap (incl. clouds and snow, excl. perennial snow and glaciers);  • RMS distance (in days) of acquisitions date from target d ate; • Max difference of acquisition date of adjacent pixels.  An example of a quality based pricing scheme is provided in  Annex  8. 5.3.2.1
5.3.2.2.1	Spectral resolution: Optical multispectral sensors used for all HR_IMAGE_2015 acquisitions must have at least one independent spectral band centred in each of the following spectral ranges to allow optimal analysis of vegetation:  Green [0.5 -0.6μm], Red [0.6 -0.68μm], NIR [0.7 -0.9μm], SWIR1 [ 1.5-1.8μm]  Radiometric resolution: minimum bit depth of 7 -bits signal dynamic range  is acceptable , higher bit depth is preferred  (e.g. 16 -bits).
5.3.2.2.2	The overall AOI of interest comprises the EEA39 national territories to a total of ~6 M km². Within this Area a number of 'large regions’ have been delineated as acquisition subunits as displayed in Annex 3.
5.3.2.2.3	The overall AOI shall be extended by a 2 nautical miles buffer for the 2014 -2015 acquisition campaign. From the operational availability of Sentinel -2 onwards, the standard territorial water of 12 nautical miles into the sea/ocean shall be taken as the buffer.
5.3.2.3.1	The objective of the wall -to-wall CO RE HR image acquisition is to cover once or twice the entire AOI (depending of the Zone) with:  • The least possible number of scenes; • Coming from the least possible sensors; • Leaving only the smallest possible gaps and  • Being acquired as close as possible to the respective reference date.
5.3.2.3.2	Data acquisition shall start the year before the reference year.  The bulk of acquisitions shall be within the reference year.  The reference year +1 is only used for gap -filling, in which case those scenes would receive an additional 7 days “off date” quality bias. In that case the increase in quality and coverage will determine the price.
5.3.2.4.1	For the acquisition campaign, separate zones are identified in Annex 4 covering a range of areas indicatively corresponding with risk levels to acquire complete coverage. It comprises a Zone A for the cloudiest areas, Zone B for cloud -prone areas, Zone C for the areas with statistically limited cloud cover frequencies and Zone D for French DOM situated under the tropics. The requirements for Zone C apply to Zone B and D if not specified otherwise.
5.3.2.4.2	To account for differences with respect to phenological effects and observation conditions (cloud probability, sun angles) and the resulting difficulties to meet the quality requirements, each AOI subunit  is assigned to one of the following zones:  Zone A:  a minimum  of one cloud -free coverage (VNIR + SWIR).  Areas at northern latitudes and/or with very narrow phenological windows and or very difficult observation conditions.  Zone B:  two cloud -free coverages (one VNIR + SWIR; second: preferably VNIR + SWIR, but VNIR only acceptable as second choice) . Areas at mid-latitudes with a high probability of suitable acquisition windows during the observation periods.  Two target dates will be specified, however the completion of the second coverage is considered a best effort.  Zone C:  two cloud -free coverages with preferably homogenous sensor VNIR + SWIR acquisitions. Areas at lower latitudes with extended phenological observation periods and predominantly clear sky conditions during those. Two target dates will be specified and accordingly two coverages are expected.  Zone D : one cloud -free coverage (VNIR + SWIR) . Overseas areas (e.g. French DOMs) .
5.3.2.5.1	The acquisition windows are defined in Annex 5  with extended and narrow windows. The starting and ending dates of these extended and narrow windows can be subject to modifications with a ten-day advance notice to allow for extension of acquisition with an earlier start and/or later end.
5.3.2.6.1	Zone A:  One VNIR + SWIR coverage in the narrow windows of acquisition; multi -mission systematic tasking over the same areas to ensure adequate coverage of the cloudiest regions.  Purchase criteria for Zone A: As a minimum, any part of acquisition (grid) with less than the high cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' requirements as long as it contributes to reaching the goal of one cloud free coverage of Zone A.
5.3.2.6.2	Zone B:  A first and most important coverage including VNIR + SWIR shall be acquired during the narrow window of acquisition, preferably through systematic tasking of one sensor, complemented with speculative tasking from other sensors and/or outside the narrow window but still inside the extended window.
5.3.2.6.3	The second cover age shall be acquired with ideally 6 weeks, but minimally with a 4 week time difference to the first coverage.  The second coverage can be either upfront or after the first coverage, but within the extended acquisition window. Preference is given to VNIR + SWIR. VNIR only is acceptable for the second coverage if SWIR is not available (second priority).
5.3.2.6.4	Purchase criteria for Zone B: As a minimum, any part of the acquisition grid with less than the cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' requirements as long as it contributes to reaching the goal of completing Zone B.
5.3.2.6.5	Zone C:  A first and most important coverage including VNIR + SWIR shall be acquired during the narrow window of acquisition.
5.3.2.6.6	The second coverage shall be acquired with ideally 6 weeks, but minimally with a 4 week time difference to the first coverage.  The second coverage can be either upfront or after the first coverage, but within the extended acquisition window. Preference is given to VNIR + SWIR. VNIR only is acceptable for the second c overage if SWIR is not available (second priority).
5.3.2.6.7	Purchase criteria for Zone C: As a minimum, any part of the acquisition grid with less than the cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' requirements as long as it contributes to reaching the goal of completing Zone C.
5.3.2.6.8	Zone D:  One coverage including VNIR + SWIR shall be acquired during the extended window of acquisition.  Purchase criteria for Zone D: As a minimum, any part of the acquisition grid with less than the cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' requirements as long as it contributes to reaching the goal of one cloud free coverage of Zone D.
5.3.2.7.1	The maximum cloud coverage allowed is defined as per a grid of 25x25 km and varies per Zone A, B. C or D (see Annex 4). It is also a function of the spatial distribution of the clouds on the scene (the presence of cloud spread all over the scene is not acceptable). This restriction aims at reducing the number of scenes to be processed and ensuring processing homogeneity. See Guidelines in Annex 9 .
5.3.2.7.2	The overall AOI comprising zones A, B, C, D will be subdivided in a uniform grid of 25 km cell side. Grid cells will, according to zone dependency, have a maximum allowed C loud Coverage threshold as follows:  • Zone A (cloudiest):  CC 2 0% max ; • Zone B (cloud prone): CC 10%  max; • Zones C/D (limited cloud): CC 5% max.
5.3.2.7.3	Scenes comprising haze shall be flagged accordingly for further consideration, and are subject to rejection by the Copernicus service coordinator, in consultation with the serv ice providers implementing the land services.
5.3.2.7.4	Presence of perennial snow and glaciers is allowed.  However, temporary snow, saturated pixels and data gaps have to be included for the above-listed calculation of the max. allowed percentages.
5.3.2.8.1	The sun elevation angle shall be higher than 20° to ensure sufficient illumination and to minimize the effect of shadows.
5.3.2.8.2	The off -nadir viewing angle shall be less than 2 5°.
5.3.2.8.3	Saturated pixels, snow (excl. perennial), clouds and areas with a signal to noise ratio of less than 50:1 (at 35% ground reflectance) will count as data gaps.
5.3.2.9.1	The data provider must assess the quality of the datasets.
5.3.2.9.2	It is up to the service coordinator, in consultation with the service providers to review the scenes proposed by the CCMEs at the end of the acquisition campaign on their appropriateness for further processing.

Level1 (system correction) : System corrected and at -sensor radiometric and geometric calibrated data; • Ortho layer, (i.e. x, y coordinates (ETRS89) ) INSPIRE compliant metadata .
5.3.2.11.1	A cascade approach may be considered for radiometric and atmospheric corrections in decreasing order of priority as follows: (a) Atmospheric corrected Surface Reflectance (or Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA)), 16 -bit data. However this option requires a well-established method. Atmospheric bands in Sentinel -2 will allow for that, entailing that this option only be considered from Sentinel -2 onwards.  (b) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) planetary reflectances, 16 -bit data.  Sensor specific in band solar irradiance values (ESUN) shall be provided.  (c) ESUN corrected but not solar elevation corrected.  (d) Radiometric calibrated data with calibration parameters enab ling the conversion of image digital numbers (DN) into spectral radiance (W/m2/sr/um) . Solar spectral irradiances within each spectral band and the solar elevation for each scene are required to  convert the image DNs into TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) reflectance values.

5.3.2.12.2	Ortho -rectification has to be full -parametric or making use of RPC functions and shall be based on the EU -DEM. In case a different DEM is used it must be supplied with the data.
5.3.2.12.3	European projection is required for all coverage ETRS89, LAEA (EPSG code 3035). National projection is optional and may be requested on a case by case basis.
5.3.2.12.4	Grid alignment: Ge oTIFF key: The GeoTIFF key ""GTRasterTypeGeoKey"" shall have the value 1, corresponding to ""RasterPixelIsArea"".
5.3.2.12.5	Pixel alignment: The values of the coordinates for the upper -left corner (x and y) of the upper -left pixel of an image dataset shall be an integer multiple of the pixel size (resolution) in the corresponding direction (x and y).

5.3.2.14.1	Zone A: After selection, delivery will be made no later than 60 days after selection.
5.3.2.14.2	Zone B: To the extent that systematic tasking has been applied for a sensor over Zone B, the same delivery requirement shall be maintained as for zone A. For non -systematic acquisitions delivery shall be made on a continuous basis, but no later than 60 days after the end of the extended acquisition windows.
5.3.2.14.3	Zones C:  Delivery shall be made on a continuous basis, but no later than 60 days after the end of the extended acquisition windows.
5.3.2.14.4	For all zones, delivery shall be made per large scale regions (acquisition subunits defined in Annex 3 ).
5.3.2.15.1	Multi -user DOWNLOAD and VIEW licences shall be acquired to cover as a baseline all relevant activities of users in [Copernicus Services], [Union_Inst ], [Union_Research _Proj ects] and [Public_Authorities].
5.3.2.15.2	[INT_ORG_NGO] and [Public] shall have access in DISCOVERY mode.
5.3.2.15.3	VIEW mode should however be considered an option towards [INT_ORG_NGO ] and will be used if affordable .
5.3.3.1.1	Spatial resolution: pixel sizes up to maximum 2m shall be considered. (Remark: the acquisition pixel size is linked with the final data product resolution, (see. Data Product requirements below)).
5.3.3.1.2	Spectral resolution: Optical multispectral sensors used for all VHR_IMAGE_2015 acquisitions must have at least one independent spectral band centred in each of the following spectral ranges to allow optimal analysis of vegetation:  Green [0.5 -0.6μm], Red [0.6 -0.68μm], NIR [0.7 -0.9μm]. Panchromatic [0.45 -0.85μm].
5.3.3.1.3	SWIR1 [ 1.5-1.8μm] is considered optional.  The availability of sensor capacities allowing for systematic inclusion without jeopardising other requirements shall trigger an investigation by ESA on the feasibility of revision of specifications to include SWIR.
5.3.3.1.4	Radiometric resolution: minimum bit depth of 7 -bit signal dynamic range is acceptable, higher bit depth is preferred, e.g. 16 -bit depth.
5.3.3.2.1	The overall AOI of interest comprises the EEA39 national territories to a total of ~6 M km² .
5.3.3.2.2	The overall AOI shall be extended by a 2 nautical miles buffer.
5.3.3.3.1	The objective of the wall -to-wall CORE VHR image acquisition is to cover once the entire AOI with:  • The least possible number of scenes; • Coming from the least possible sensors; • Leaving only the smallest possible g aps and • Being acquired as close as possible to the respective reference date.
5.3.3.3.2	Data acquisition shall start the year before the reference year.  The bulk of acquisitions shall be within the reference year.  The reference year +1 is only used for gap -filling, in which case those scenes will receive an additional 7 days “off date” quality bias. In that case the increase in quality and coverage will determine the price.
5.3.3.4.1	The acquisition windows are defined in Annex 5 with extended and narrow windows. The starting and ending dates of these extended and narrow windows can be subject to modifications with a ten day advance notice to allow for extension of acquisition with an earlier start and/or later end.
5.3.3.5.1	The acquisition strategy shall take into account the knock -on effects of scattered footprint patterns (i.e. different sensors, different years, different seasons), having a multiplicative effect on the coherence and size of working units as a collection of images with sufficiently stable characteristics to automate classification processes on single selection of areas. This entails optimisation of series of acquisitions with regard to the areas as defined in Annex 4.
5.3.3.6.1	The maximum cloud coverage allowed per scene is function of the swath of the sensor and the percentage of cloud de fined per Zone A, B, C or D (see. Annex 4). The maximum cloud coverage allowed per scene is also function of the spatial distribution of the clouds on the scene (the presence of cloud spread all over the scene is not acceptable). This restriction aims at reducing the number of scenes to be processed and ensuring processing homogeneity.
5.3.3.6.2	The overall AOI comprising zones A, B, C, D will be subdivided in a uniform grid of side 25 km. Gri d cells will, according to zone dependency, have a maximum allowed C loud Coverage (CC)  threshold as follows:  • Zone A (cloudiest): CC 20% max ; • Zone B (cloud prone): CC 10% max ; • Zones C/D (limited cloud): CC 5% max.

5.3.3.6.4	Presence of perennial snow and glaciers is allowed.  However, temporary snow, saturated pixels and data gaps have to be included for the above listed calculation of the maximum allowed percentages.
5.3.3.7.1	The sun elevation angle shall be higher than 20° (preferable higher than 23°) to ensure sufficient illumination and to minimize the effect of shadows.
5.3.3.7.2	The off-nadir viewing angle shall be less than 30°.

Level 1  (system correction) : • System corrected and at -sensor radiometric and geometric calibrated data;  • Ortho layer, (i.e. x, y coordinates (ETRS89 ) INSPIRE compliant metadata .
5.3.3.10.1	A cascade approach may be considered for radiometric and atmospheric corrections in decreasing order of priority as follows:  (a) Atmospheric corrected Surface Reflectance (or Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA)), 16 -bit data. However, this option requires a well-established method. Atmospheric bands in Sentinel -2 will allow for that, entailing that this option only be considered from Sentinel -2 onwards.  (b) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) planetary reflectances, 16 -bit data.  Sensor specific in band solar irradiance values (ESUN) shall be provided . (c) ESUN corrected but not solar elevation corrected.

Solar spectral irradiances within each spectral band and the solar elevation for each scene are required to convert the image DNs into TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) reflectance values.
5.3.3.11.1	Ortho ready processing shall include basic corrections such as rectilinear geometry, radiometric distortion (i.e. source data) .
5.3.3.11.2	Ortho -rectification has to be full -parametric or making use of RPC functions and shall be based on the EU -DEM. In case a different DEM is used it must be supplied with the data.
5.3.3.11.3	European projection is required for all coverage ETRS89, LAEA (EPSG code 3035). National projection is optional and may be requested on a case by case basis.

5.3.4.3.2	Data acquisition shall start the year before the reference year.  The bulk of acquisitions shall be within the reference year.  The reference year +1 is only used for gap-filling, in which case those scenes will receive an additional 7 days “off date” quality bias. In that case the increase in quality and coverage will determine the reimbursement.
5.3.4.4.1	In order of priority, composites over the following subgroups of months are important:  1. June-July 2. April -May 3. August-September 4. March 5. October
5.3.4.4.2	Ideally, the area to be covered by the MR composites shall be temporally and spatially synchronised with HR_IMAGE_2015.
