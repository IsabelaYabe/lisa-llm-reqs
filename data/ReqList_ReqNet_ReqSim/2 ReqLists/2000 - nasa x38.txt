3.2.2.1.22	The scheduler shall [SRS034] take no longer than 1 millisecond to execute scheduler and Time Services FTSS overhead tasks in each rate group.  This means that the time from the 50 Hz timer interrupt to the start of the first task in the 50 Hz rate group will be less than or equal to 1 millisecond, assuming 27 packets of data need to be delivered.

3.2.2.3.2	The scheduler shall [SRS031] provide a mechanism for a task optionally to define a user written software-exception-handling routine that runs in the context of the task.
3.2.2.3.3	For hardware exceptions and reserved exceptions, the FTSS shall [SRS276] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then return from the exception handler to the task that was running when the exception occurred.
3.2.2.3.4	For software exceptions occurring within the FTSS, the FTSS shall [SRS277] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then restart the offending task at its beginning.
3.2.2.3.5	For other software exceptions, regardless of whether or not a user written exception handling routine is invoked, if an exception occurs, the scheduler shall [SRS173], after making available the error type and context data to the application, resume processing (after the exception-handling routine runs, if provided) at the initialization point of the offending task.
3.2.2.3.6	For software exceptions occurring during Startup, FTSS shall [SRS301] issue a VME reset to the FCR in which the exception occurred.

3.2.4.0.4	Communication services shall [SRS050] restrict the use of "immediate" message passing services between virtual groups (from FCP to ICP) to tasks running in the highest rate group on the FCP. This restriction does NOT apply to the ICPs since they are running as simplex VGs.
3.2.4.0.5	Communication services shall [SRS051] detect message passing between application tasks living on the same virtual group and bypass the usage of the network element.
3.2.4.0.6	Communication services shall [SRS052] route messages to the proper virtual group(s) and socket.
3.2.4.0.7	Communication services shall [SRS053] deliver messages in the same order at each member of a virtual group.

The "create" and "open" API calls for synchronous sockets allow the application to specify the maximum message size and how many incoming messages the socket may buffer.
3.2.4.1.0.2	If there is insufficient space to enqueue a message for transmission, Communication services shall [SRS059] return an error to the corresponding task. Sockets are non-blocking and place the burden of polling on the application task.
3.2.4.1.1.1	Communication services shall [SRS062] provide a message queue communication mechanism that guarantees message delivery between a sending and receiving task.
3.2.4.1.1.2	Communication services shall [SRS063] provide an API for "message queue" communication.

3.2.4.1.1.4	The message queue "create" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers. Communication services shall [SRS066] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to "open" the respective end of the queue.
3.2.4.1.2.1	Communication services shall [SRS067] provide a "pipe" communication mechanism allowing immediate message passing through the network and allowing a 50hz FCP transfer task to poll until it can read an immediate message from the ICP.
3.2.4.1.2.2	Communication services shall [SRS068] provide an API for "pipe" communication.

3.2.4.1.2.4	Communication services shall [SRS070] provide the following error handling information as feedback to the "pipe" API calls: a)	notification of invalid or out of range application specified parameters on all operations, b)	notification of an attempt to create a broadcast pipe with an ICP as the sending virtual group, c)	pipe "open" of end point ( SENDER/RECEIVER ) by non-assigned virtual group, d)	notification upon receiving a message that the previous message was overwritten, e)	connection/transmission error, f)	FTSS unable to create/open pipe, and g)	notification that a received message was truncated to the buffer size provided.
3.2.4.1.2.5	If the broadcast option is used, each virtual group should open the pipe and read from it to avoid flow control problems.
3.2.4.1.2.6	The "pipe" "create" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers. Communication services shall [SRS073] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to "open" the respective end of the pipe. In the case of a broadcast "pipe", communication services allows one task in each virtual group of the system to open the receiving end of the "pipe".

3.2.6.2.0.2	When the FCP virtual group is configured as a quadruplex and a failed FCR other than the NEFU has been diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS106] degrade the FCP virtual group to triplex, removing the FCR.  The NE and the processors on the failed FCR will be removed from the NEsâ€™ Configuration Table (CT) and recovery of that channel will then take place, if alignment is permitted.  Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
3.2.6.2.0.3	When the FCP virtual group is configured as a triplex, and if the NEFU is still active (4 NEs active total), and a failed FCR other than the NEFU has been diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS282] degrade the FCP virtual group to degraded triplex, removing the FCR.  The NE and the processors on the failed FCR will be removed from the NEsâ€™ Configuration Table (CT) and recovery of that channel will then take place, if alignment is permitted.

The NE will remain in the CT and no recovery will take place.  Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
3.2.6.2.0.5	If a failure in an FCR other than the NEFU is diagnosed when the FCP is configured as a degraded triplex, no action shall [SRS254] be taken.

Note also that the failed NEFU could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
3.2.6.2.0.7	For the NEFU, if errors are identified after the processor has been masked out, and if at least 4 NEs are still active, the NE shall [SRS283] be removed from the configuration and recovery will be attempted.  Note that the NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.

3.2.6.2.0.13	From the time that the FCR failure has been identified, if the components of the FCR are recoverable and alignment is permitted, to the time the FCR is recovered, shall [SRS205] be no more than 1.5 minutes.
3.2.6.2.0.14	Redundancy Management shall [SRS208], within 60 milliseconds after 1.5 minutes has elapsed since the voted reset was sent to the failed channel, if the voted reset fails to recover the failed channel and alignment is still allowed, request from the application a power cycle of the channel. (Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.)
3.2.6.2.0.15	Redundancy Management shall [SRS209], within 60 milliseconds after 1.5 minutes has elapsed since the first power cycle request, if the FCR has not been recovered and alignment is still allowed, issue another request to the application for a power cycle of the channel. (Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.)
3.2.6.2.0.16	Redundancy Management shall [SRS211], if power cycle requests fail to result in a recovered channel, request the application to power down the channel and declare the channel to be permanently failed.  Note that the same result will occur if the application software ignores or fails to respond to power cycle requests.
