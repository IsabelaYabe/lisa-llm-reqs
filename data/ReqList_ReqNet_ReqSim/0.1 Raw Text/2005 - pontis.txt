Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
1.0 Introduction 
This report documents the functional re quirements specification (FRS) for the  
next genera tion of th e Pontis Bridge Manage ment Sys tem (BMS), referred to a s 
Pontis 5 .0 throughout.  These  includ e the functional re quirements, which 
describe the operations tha t user s must per form using Pontis 5.0, the non-
functional req uirements , which des cribe the manner in wh ich the soft ware will 
be designed, developed, and dep loyed, and the plan fo r implementation of 
Pontis 5. 0. 
Throughout  this document, the terms “s hall” and “will” are used to identify 
specific f unctions and capabilit ies that Pontis 5.0 must provide (e.g., Pontis 
inspection interface shall provide the ability to perform data validation on 
National Bridge Invento ry items).  The terms “ may” a nd “might” are used to  
indicate functions and c apabilities that ma y or may not be included in the final 
product (e.g., Pontis may provide a  dire ct link to GIS soft ware for map-based  
query ing).  The status of these items will be resolved thr ough future detailed 
software d esign activity or thro ugh progre ss by other vendors in the 
development and deplo yment of Po ntis add-in a pplications. 
Note that t his docume nt is not intended to describe the architecture  or data 
model of Pontis 5.0, nor is it intended to describe the specific  design or 
implementa tion plan f or any fun ctional requirement.  This information wil l 
appear in later Pontis 5. 0 syste m design documents.  Preliminary work has been  
performed to outline the technical archit ecture for Pontis 5.0, a nd a Technical 
Architecture Description  (TAD) was developed in 2003.1  The TAD pres ents a 
future vision for the  project, emphas izing a web application, an  advanced 
database architecture, m aximum reuse of user reports and forms, and a flex ible, 
extensible user interface. 
This docum ent, once a pproved in final  form, indicates agreement bet ween the  
AASHTO P ontis Task Force, on behalf of the Pontis licensing agenc ies, and 
Cambridge Systematics, on the spec ific fu nctions and capabilities that Pontis 5.0 
must provide, providing a clear a nd specif ic scope of services for th e software  
design and  development effort.  Any su bsequent changes to the functional 
requ irements must be careful ly review ed and  considered, because t hey may 
impact the project schedule and/or or ex pand the  scope of work beyond th at 
which is covered by the design and development contract between AASHTO and 
the software developer.

Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
This docum ent follows the structure and  outline of the Volere Requirements 
Specifi cation Template.2  This approach was identified in previous discussions  
and documents.3  Some sections of th is template do not apply to Pontis 5.0, a nd 
have therefore been marked as such in the text of this report,  or om itted in their 
entirety.   
The TAD provides a general ar chitecture fo r the future versi on of Pontis.  It does 
not elaborat e requirements for t he new system  in detail, although it does identify  
key stake holders and st akeholder concerns to be considered in the future Pontis  
version.  A specific re quirements gatherin g eff ort is necessary before the desig n 
and implementation of Pontis 5. 0 may commenc e.  
To that e nd, the BRI DGEWare Task Force has d esignated t he contractor, 
Cambridge Systematics,  to underta ke a requirements gathering process with 
guidance and substan tive input from  a s et of bridge manage ment and 
information systems experts who will ser ve as a Technical Ad visor y Group  
(TAG).  Cambridge Systematics a nd the TAG work within the framew ork of the  
Volere Requirements Process Model as the fo rmal requirements development 
methodology.  
In the  Volere methodolo gy, there are  several main phase s: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
                                                     Project Blastoff - Define the  project sc ope, contex t, and participants, and  
initiate the r equirements process  
Trawling F or Knowle dge - Coll ect information needed to write  the 
requirements document 
Reporting - Compile the requirements and write the require ments document 
Quality Gateway – (continuously) Revi ew the requirem ents as the y are 
drafted for completeness, relevance, and viabilit y 
Prototyping and Scenario Modeli ng – (eventually) Develop low-f idelity  
and/or high-fidelity (HiFi) prototypes to better develop the requirements 
Perform Requirements Gathering E ffort  Post-m ortem (Retrospective Review ) 
- review outcome of the requireme nts process following completion of the 
requirements document 
Take Stock Of The Requirements – Determine if the requirements are  
complete and internally consistent 
These phases culminate in this r equirements specificatio n which can move  
forward to the formal so ftware desig n phase .

Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
2.0 Project Drivers 
2.1 PURPOSE OF T HE PRODUCT  
Pontis 5.0 will pro vide licensing agencies  with an up-to-date tool for bridg e 
manage ment, includin g data  managem ent, condition ass essment, model  
development, needs analysis, reporting,  and interaction with other agency 
systems.  Pontis 5.0 will be the next generation of the Pontis prod uct, currently 
deployed in more than  45 age ncies in the U. S. and abroad.  This product is 
intended to replace the  existing Po ntis 4.x  pro duct line with a  nex t-generation 
software application, ut ilizing state-of-the -art software development technology.  
Pontis 5.0 will build on and preserve lic ensee investments of time and money in 
Pontis 4.x  implementat ion. 
The nex t generation of Pontis even tually will offer the full functionality of the 
currently deployed Pontis 4.4.  The ba seline capabilit ies will be e xtended to 
provide li censees the ab ility to acce ss se lected modules fro m a web br owser as  
well as a dedicated clie nt application, de pendi ng on the p articula r BMS activity.   
A web versi on of Pontis will offer e asier applic ation setup, administration, and 
implementation, and wi ll pro vide a straig htfor ward migration path  for ex isting 
Pontis 4.x  users. 
Pontis 5.0 will suppor t a range of new functionality, inc luding: imp ort and 
export of data in eXstensible Markup Language  (XML) based on t he TransXML  
schema being developed through National Cooperative Highway Research 
Program (NCHRP) Project 20-64 , XML Sc hemas for Ex change of Transportation 
Data (Trans XML); improved approaches  to modeling bridge needs through 
incorpo ration of research results from NC HRP 12-67, Mult iple- Objective  
Optimization for Bridge Managem ent Syst ems; improved user interfaces for 
bridge-level analysis  and pr oject planning;  and  support for multiple asset type s.  
Further, Pontis 5.0 will provide seamless support to its l icensees for  potential 
changes in the National Bridge In ventory (NBI) coding stan dards. 
The development of Pontis 5.0 is dri ven in part by new functional requirements 
as well as by dramatic technology changes in t he software  development arena  
that h ave overtaken th e existing client/ser ver application, p articula rly in the web 
application development domain. 
Specific Goals for Pontis 5.0 
The goals for Pontis 5.0 are to prov ide the AASHTO member agencies and  
licensees with:   
A readily-accessible , robust  repos itory for  bridge inform ation, including 
data invento ry, condition, need s, project plans, and accomplishments;  •

• 
• 
                                                     Technically correct  capabilities  to perform bridge manage ment task s of all 
types; 
A technologically up-to-date  development foundation; 
Streamlined, simpler  application and deploym ent mechani sms;   
A flexible, customizable  application which use rs can ex tend to solve a gency-
specific bridge man agement t asks;  and 
Preservation  of significant agency i nvestments  in BMS generally and P ontis 
specifically, including expenditures of time, money, trai ning and o ther 
agency resources. 
The Technical Architec ture Descri ption (TAD) identifies additional goals an d 
concerns of a number of Pontis stak eholder s, which are reflected in these  
summary goals.4  
In this cont ext, the bold-faced terms appearing a bove are defined as follows: 
Readily accessible  me ans that information s tored in P ontis 5. 0 should be 
available to most users via Microsoft Inte rnet Explorer from any computer via a 
network or Internet connection; a nd the soft ware enables users to access the 
majority of data and capabilities wi thout specialized technical skills or tr aining. 
Robust  means t hat: a) the reposit ory is built on a com mercial, high-q uality 
relational database m anageme nt system (RDBMS); b) the information contained  
in the syste m is secure, with access lim ited to appropriate staff and agency-
designated  parties; c) information contained in the sy stem c an be backe d up in a 
secure locat ion on a regular schedule; and d) the system is reliable and in 
operation at an acceptable levels of ava ilability a nd perform ance.  Ponti s 4.4 and  
5.0 address item (a) and (d) but assi gn primary responsibilit y for (b) and (c) to  
licensing agencies.   
Technically correct capabilities means th at th e various ana lysis and calculation  
in Pontis 5.0 operate c onsistently and comparably with e xisting versions, a nd 
where there  may be op portunities for impr ovements or innovation in technical 
capabilit ies these are well- understood, well-defined, and verifiab le in the 
deployed application.  As an ex ample, continued proper calculation of NBI 
Translator results will b e part of achieving this goal. 
Technologically up-to-date  mandates the desi gn and development of the next  
generation Pontis application using nex t generation tools, such as .NET, we b 
services, SOAP, XML, Model-View-Con troller architecture, and others. 
Streamlined, simpler administrati on means that agencies will find it e asier and 
faster to ins tall, deploy, and upgrade the application, and manage  its operation.

Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
Pontis 5.0 must address this objective e xplicitly and m ust be sign ificantly  
improved o ver current version(s). 
Flexible,  customizable  means  that the applicat ion provides inna te me chanisms  
for ex tendin g and adapting the dat abase  sche ma, foundation capabilities, and  
user presentation elements such as fo rms and reports.  This has been a key 
benefit of the existing product.  The futu re Pontis 5.0 product should be capable 
of adapting  to changes  in data req uirements,  reporting, standards , and other 
influencing factors. 
Preservation of agency  investment s means  that the significant body of  effort to 
develop staff expertise, data, reports, da ta form s, procedures, ma nuals, training 
courses, and the multitude of other BM S-related agency  products must be  
explicitly a cknowledged and preserved in  Pontis 5.0 to  the greate st extent  
possible.  This goal also means provid ing a straightforward migration path for 
Pontis and  integrated B RIDGEWare database s when moving to Pon tis 5.0. 
We ex plicitly recognize that  these priorities an d needs  may change  over time, 
and th at the functional req uirements  and  technical design m ay neces sarily adapt 
to accommodate th ese c hanges  in priorities and needs. 
2.2 STAKEHOLDERS  
The TAD identifies Pontis stake holders in  some detail, and  these  continue to be 
applicab le.  The TAD o utlines issue s of concern  to each stakeholder cla ss which 
form a basis for identifying constraints on the Po ntis 5.0 functional requirements .  
The stakeho lders defined in the TAD include: 
End users , grouped into:  • 
• 
• 
• 
• – power use rs, who typic ally would manage  an agency’s Pontis dat abase 
and/or make heavy use of its analyti c/modeling capabilit ies; 
– routine us ers, such as bridge inspectors or staff data an alyst s, responsible 
for p rimary  data collect ion, quality reviews, and normal data reporting.  
These are t he predominant se t of Po ntis users; a nd 
– casual user s, such as  planning o r program ming staff  using Po ntis 
inventory data and analytical result s. 
Agencies : the governmental or other entities r esponsible for procurin g and  
operating Pontis;  
AAS HTO: the software product’s owner; 
Developers:  those resp onsible for building and maintaini ng BRIDGEWare 
components, including t hird party developers;  
Integrators:  those who i ntegrate Pontis services or data with other tool s and 
systems ; and 
Cambridge Systema tics, Inc. 2-3 
Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
Deployers:  those responsible for installin g, configuring and customizing  
Pontis for use. • 
All the stakeholders are still impo rtant, but fo r the re quirements dev elopment 
phase, we are highlighting the most important st akeh olders concerned with 
reviewing and approvi ng require ments in this FRS.  The  table below identifies 
the key front-line Pontis stakeholders and outlin es their role  with respect to the

2.3 USERS OF THE PRODU CT  
Pontis users are classi fied as des cribed in the following paragraphs for th e 
purposes of this requirements document. 
Inspectors:   inspectors may be age ncy sta ff inspecting bridges full or part-
time/seasonally, or c onsultants.  Bri efly, their  r esponsibiliti es entail original 
bridge data colle ction, review, and data base q uantification.  Their activities  
may also  include developing field work recommendatio ns and 
accomplish ment verification.  These users may or ma y not be licensed 
engineers; • 
• 
• Bridge pro ject planners:   staff responsible for development, review,  
approval, and tracking  of bridge work  of all types,  whe ther maint enance, 
improveme nts, rehabilit ation or repl acement; 
Bridge management engineers:  staff responsible for m ultiple aspects of 
bridge man agement, concerned with inspection program accomplish ment, 
2-4  Cambridge Systema tics, Inc. 
Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
program d evelopment and implementa tion, bridge po licies, and other  
overarching concerns such as tr uck routing and permit revie w; 
Bridge design/rating engineers:  staff responsible for bridge design  and  
rating, who may need information from Pontis when ma king engineering  
decisions, and who ma y contribute stru cture design and ca pacity information 
to Pontis; • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• Highway information analysts:  staff res ponsible for collection and  
maintena nce of various data of c oncern to bridge management  such as  
roadway ser vice le vels, traffic, ro uting restriction s, etc; 
Highway p rogram planners:   staf f concerned with integ ration of project 
plans within highway corridors, a nd in particular, to acknowledge, review, 
and incorporate bridge project recomme ndati ons originat ing from bridge 
manage ment or other sources, and to provide feedback to bridge 
manage ment on project accomplish ments; and 
Other Pontis users:  staff with interest in b ridge infor mation such as 
executives, public re lations officers, en gineerin g firms (primarily serving as 
inspection contractors), and other c asual users of the sy stem.  These users 
may or may not have an engin eerin g background and are prim arily 
concerned with data review, perfor mance measures identification and 
tracking, an d summary inventory/condition reports. 
Clearly some of these users fall int o secondary and tertiary categories.  Where 
there is a conflict, the requirements of th e key i nternal users must take  priority 
over those of secondary users.  Th e tert iary category of us ers may ma ke use of 
Pontis, but have no ves ted interest in th e product.  The re quirements of these  
users are of lowest priority. 
2.4 PROJECT CONSTRAINTS  
This section describes constraints o n the require ments and t he eventual design of 
the product.  These constraints reflec t a number of s takeholder concerns  
identified in the TAD. 
Development Technolo gy Constraints  
Pontis  5.0 w ill be developed using Microsoft technologies, as follows: 
Pontis 5.0 will be a Microsoft .NET a pplication  consisting of a combination of 
stand-alon e, thin client,  and back-e nd server applications.  There ma y be 
duplicative  capabilitie s between th e thin-client and the stan d-alone 
implementations.  Providing a stand-al one field inspection application for  
disconnected users as w ell as a web inspection interface is a n example. 
The thin client will be designed and test ed for the latest ver sion of Micr osoft  
Internet Exp lorer, ve rsion to be deter mined durin g design. 
Cambridge Systema tics, Inc. 2-5 
Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
The stand-al one application will requir e workstations with the .NET Runtime  
Framework installed and the Wind ows XP  ope rating syste m.  The spe cific 
version will  be determined during de sign.  W hile the .N ET Framework is 
distributed as part o f the Wind ows operat ing system  and with  .NET 
applications for end use rs, .NET ser ver licenses likely will be needed as well, 
which may mean a n expense for licensing ag encies. • 
• 
• 
• The server application will expect and rely on the .NET Fr amework and the  
common lan guage runtime (CLR). 
Microsoft V isual Stud io .NET wi ll be used as the primary development tool  
for Pontis 5.0.  The development languages will be heterogeneous and 
determined appropriately for the a pplication contex t and therefore may 
include Visual Basic .NET, C#, ASP.NET scri pting, or others  as appropriate.   
Pontis 5.0 will maximi ze the use of th ird-party code libr aries, whether fee-
licensed or open-source, to minimize origin al develop ment costs to the 
greatest exte nt possible. 
General Solution Constraints  
• 
• 
• 
• 
                                                     The Pontis 5.0 thin-client will be desi gned  so it can be made available to users 
via agency internal n etwork and  over  the Internet,  as appropriat e for  
different application contex ts, with final deployment arrange ment 
determined by each licensee. 
Pontis 5.0 will take ful l advantage of web display capabil ities includ ing, in 
particular, screen real estate manageme nt to mi nimize scrolling, paging and 
tabbing. 
The BRIDGEWare database design for Po ntis 5.0 will be consistent with the 
database design for Pontis 4.4.  Chan ges are very likely to be neces sary but 
proposed database changes will need to  be reviewed and approved by the 
BRIDGEWare Databas e Technical Advi sory Group (T AG)  as part of the 
Pontis 5.0 design approval process following the agreed  database c hange  
protocol.5 
Pontis will support it s existing r elational databases (RDBMS) of Sy base 
Adaptive Server Anywhere, Oracle, and Microsoft SQ L Server a s the 
database for its information repository .  The versions of each v endor’s 
RDBMS w ill be determined as part  of the software design and 
 
5 The B RIDGEWar e Task Forces h ave establ ished  a speci fic pro tocol for  requesting, 
reviewin g, and approvin g an y database chan ges.  Each proposed  change is described, 
prioritized, and as signed to an im pact/threa t category.  Substa ntive justif ication must  
be provided for every ch ange, and n o changes are permitted to the BRIDGEWare  
database desi gn wi thout the consensus of  the da tabase Technica l Adv isory Group  
(TAG).

implementa tion plan.  No additional da tabase support is anticipated as of  
this writing, but the design will adhere strictly to  ANSI-S QL and 
ODBC/JDBC/.NET standards in order to  maximize the potential to support  
additional database s in t he future.

                                                     Pontis brid ge information will i ntegrate with a more general asset 
manage ment database s tructure which ma y incorporate other types of assets 
such as sign structures, h igh-mast to wers, walls, pavements, or buildings . 
Pontis 5.0 will be a GIS-aware applicatio n that must operate properly within 
an age ncy’s GIS techno logy wheth er ESRI, Int ergraph, Open GIS, or o thers.  
Pontis must  observe in dustry stan dard  protocols in this regard and avoid  
vendor specific implementation appr oaches. 
Anticipated Application Wor kplace Environments 
Pontis 5.0 will be use d both in field contexts, such as an open-air b ridge  
inspection, where environmental factor s (we ather, sunli ght) may  influence 
program operation and no network connectivity may be ass umed, as well as in a 
typical agency office environment, which will i mpose no special restri ctions or  
requirements on the desi gn or operation of the sy stem.6 
2.5 NAMING CONVENTIONS AND DEFINITIONS  
This docum ent relies o n transport ation and i nformation technology terms tha t 
are in common use and do not  require detailed definitions.  Where a conflict  
arises, the current Pontis 4.x terminology will a pply.7 
The development of Pontis 5.0 will adhere  to a separate software development  
standards document which will itsel f incorporat e naming conventions.   
2.6 RELEV ANT FACTS AND  ASSUMPTION S 
This section  describes a ssumptions made by t he project te am a s well  as any 
known ex ternal factors t hat affect a nd/or constrain the  Pont is 5.0  syst em.  A brief 
discussion is presented  here.  Whe re appropriate, the external factors may be  
elaborated further in separate mem oranda or th e detailed d esign. 
Pontis 5.0  must not a ssume a un iform opera ting environment and  must  
accommodate both disconnected and connected users. 
 
6  No special support for  tablet or handhe ld comp uters is antic ipated at present but 
support ing t his type of technology m ay well  become a design cons traint at some  point . 
7 The reader is inv ited to rev iew the Pontis 4.x Use r and Techni cal M anuals, and in 
particular, the Glossary of Terms, a s well as the Federal NBI cod ing gu ide fo r bridge 
inspection terminology.

application,  which in effect serves to  a great extent as a hi-fidelity (hi-fi) 
prototype for Pontis 5.0. 
The Pontis  5.0 de sign must incorporate any  Federal NBI changes  that may  
arise during  the design and development period. 
Pontis 5. 0 must use te chnology th at the  mem ber agencies of AASHTO can  
deploy and support, hence, the ge neral constraint identified earlier – that  
Pontis 5.0 will be a Microsoft .NE T applicatio n, utilizing industry standard 
RDBMS technologies. 
The actual development strategy will mini mize  original co ding in favor of  
utilizing thi rd-part l ibraries, even at the expense of possibl y foregoing some 
functionalit y that custom coding could provid e.  It should be understood 
clearly by reviewers that this sort of tradeoff of cost and functionality may  
well retroac tively influe nce the final Pontis 5.0 req uirements8.  This f urther 
implies that some curre nt Pontis 4.4 capabilitie s may be implemented very  
differently in a future version in  order to take advant age of available 
commercial and open-source code. 
Pontis 5.0 will be designed as a depl oyed/installed appli cation in agencies, 
and not  designed as  a hosted application, although it may well o perate 
perfectly acceptably in a hosted confi guration, such as a Citri x environment. 
Pontis 5.0 American D isabilities Act (ADA) compliance9 constraints o n the 
functional r equirements will be dete rmined by AAS HTO in consultation with  
its member agencies.   The level and  approa ch for achieving compliance 
remains an open issue t o be resolved10. 
Pontis 5.0 will be a licensed prod uct, which AAS HTO will maintain 
ownership over, and which will be depl oyed with lice nse protection to 
certain licensees such as consultants,  international agencies , and acade mic 
institutions11. 
Pontis 5.0 m ust interact effectively a nd properly with the other BRIDGEWare  
products. 
 
8 As of this version, no particular third-party software has been selected for use in Pontis 
5.0.

10 No particular accommo dation fo r ADA comp liance is cur rently incorpor ated in t he 
requ irements  as of this revision.  
11 Copy prot ection is  not  enforced  in Pont is 4.x for U. S. licens ing agencies and it is 
assumed t hat policy w ill prevai l for  Pontis 5.0.  The arr angem ent for l icens ing web  
applic ation users is  to be determined at  a lat er stage.

• The design of Pontis 5.0 will be info rmed by review of the r esults of NCHRP 
Project 12-67, Multiple-Objective Optimization for Bridge Manag ement 
Systems.  Additional funding may be re quired to modify the Pontis modeling 
approach to incorporate new  approaches devel oped as p art of this project.  
The estima tes in t his document to not attempt  to q uantify such additional 
funding requirements. 
Pontis 5.0 must provide well-defined and do cumented access to selected 
product fun ctionality and data for third-party developers. 
The Pontis 5.0 business rules will be similar to those of Ponti s 4.x. 
Where a conflict arises between 5.0 r equirements  and 4.x  behavior, or wh en a 
4.x feature is being aban doned or signif icantly reworked, this design decision 
will be exp licitly doc umented and justified.  For example, the Pontis for mula 
language an d support for Pontis 2.0  file ex change formats are very likely to 
be discarded in Pontis 5 .0.  A conflic t or concern may aris e where there is an 
explicitly identified improvement to th e 4.x functional design, such as t he 
organization and opera tion of the S elect tool for selecting bridges on the  
Pontis desk top in a Web deployed environment.  An agreed procedure and 
protocol wi ll be needed to facilitate making a collecti ve deci sion on these 
sorts of high ly visible functional changes.

4.0 Functional Requirements 
This section of the report outlines the  functional req uirements  for Pontis 5 .0 – the 
specific tasks and activities that the soft ware en ables, other functions needed to 
support th e software,  and the data that are require d to support these  
requirements.  The requirements are organi zed loosely around a set of Pontis 5.0 
use cases.  Each requirement is numbered for convenience.  Please note that the  
“may” req uirements in version 0.2 of the FRS have been moved to Section 7.4 - 
Waiting Room - for future review and discussion.   
A separate  database  of requirements  presents each of these  narrative 
requirements generally following th e Vole re Requirements template specification  
and may be reviewed in conjunction with  this document.  In the Pontis 5.0  
requirements database, requirements that  apply only to the thin-client or thick-
client imple mentations are tagged for clar ity.  Where appropriate, requirements 
that involve configurable control of prog ram behavior are noted.  For example, it 
may be t hat a user is  not allowed multip le sessi ons of the application b y agency 
policy, henc e the require ment has a configuration  implication.  
The numbering convention below is to first identify the use case e.g., UC-1 View

4.8 DATA REQUI REMENT S  
A ful l, detailed data model for Pontis 5. 0 will become part of the Pontis 5.0 
System De sign and  is beyond t he scope o f this document.  Th e Pontis  
4.x/BRIDGEWare data base design is assumed as th e basis for these req uirements 
except as indicated.  The following is a list of basic table groupings as defined i n 
the Pon tis Technical Manual.    
Physical In ventory:  This set of ta bles contains data relat ed to an ag ency’s  
physical bridge inventory.  These include general inventory data, work  
candidates  recommendations, str uctures ex changed du ring the check-
in/check-out process, multimedia  document links, and  optional agency-
specific in ventory data.  • 
• 
• 
• 
• Program Simulation:  These tab les store data related  to the program 
simulation process.  They contain elicitation data, deterioration m odel 
updating data, preser vation policy, fl exible  action definitions, program  
simulation inputs, and simulation results.   
Project Planning:  These tables cont ain information about programs and 
funding sources, projects and th eir work  items, agency-defined project data,  
and temporarily stored work items used to support the bridge analysis  
functionality. 
Definition:  Pontis sys tem defini tions are stored in these tables. 
Appl ication  System:  Appl ication  syst em tables store configuration  dat a 
required for running Po ntis.  Th e tables contain sys tem d ata including the  
data dictionary, parameter, configurab le options, data on users and their 
roles, formulas, and o ther system data.  It is likely that extensive changes will 
be made in these t ables for Pontis 5.0, particularly to s upport auditing, 
logging, versioning, user authenticati on and ses sion manag ement, and other 
new capabilities.

5.0 Non-Functional Requirements 
5.1 LOOK  AND FEEL REQU IREMENTS  
The EIM&D SS design will be inform ed by Worl d Wide We b Consortium (W3C) 
design guidelines26 and conform to common industry practices  for user 
interaction behavior and user interface de sign.  For the thin-client portion of 
Pontis, the AAS HTO  standards for thin-clie nt web-based applications software 
will be fol lowed. 
The softwar e, through its user interface,  will cl early identify the product name  
(Pontis 5.0. x), the licensee, the c onnected user, and th e organizat ion that 
developed the sy stem ( AASHTO).  Additio nal session identification information  
will be avail able on demand.27  The overall look  and feel of the product will be 
that of a professional an d conservative application.   
Pontis 5.0 will, at AASH TO’s directi on, adopt any elements of the look and feel 
of other ex isting AASHTOWare/BRIDGEWare  applications where appropriate.  
In particula r, UI conve ntions from Virtis /Op is will be reviewed to ensure that 
the Pontis 5.0 does not d iffer markedly in appearance.  AASHTO may designate  
such model applications and must provid e the development team with access to 
fully-docum ented style sheets/UI la youts or demonstration  software to support 
this requirement. 
There will be no support for indi vidual personalization of the user interface 
(skins) oth er than  the availability of certai n features that  are tied to a user role  
(e.g. not all users will h ave the ability to edit bridge data and thus will not see an 
“Edit On” b utton on the  corresponding screen). 
5.2 USABILITY REQUIREMENT S 
Pontis 5.0 will be designed to be as stra ightforward and intuitive as possible, and 
familiar to existing use rs.  The user in terface will pro vide effective navigation,  
visual refer encing, and task sequencing .  User s will have access to on-line help  
throughout the UI.   
The applica tion should look and feel consistent in the web and st andalon e 
operating environments, therefore it w ill conform to standard .NET standalone

The syst em developer shall consider supporting existing custom forms and  
reports developed in PowerBuilde r 9.  It shall decide on a development tool for 
users so that they can continue to custom ize Pontis and extend its capability.  Fo r 
example, custom forms and reports cr eated with PowerBuilde r 9 may be  
migrated to a .NET application  by using the Sybase DataWin dow .NET 
technology which is available in PowerBuilde r 10.   
Integrating DataWindo w .NET is likely a sh ort-term strateg y to ease mi gration of 
user forms and reports to Pontis  5.0.   A st ated objective for Pont is 5.0  is 
eliminating dependency on PowerB uilder .  Ide ally, the application sh ould not  
require any particular vendor techn ology fo r report or for m generation, such as 
InfoMaker/PowerBuilder, so a sunset plan must be developed to outline a 
strategy to meet this objective.   However, the application shall continue to 
provide a plug-in cap ability to integrat e third-party .NET data displays and  
reports in the user workspace.28 
5.3 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT S 
This section describes general performance requi rements for Pontis 5.0, including  
its capacity (the volume of all types of data that  can be stored in the re pository) 
and its spe ed (the time i t takes  to ex ecute certain types of o perations). 
Some factors that deter mine the ult imate performance of Pontis are outside the 
control of this project, and rely ins tead on  decisions an d actions of ea ch agency  
that implem ents Po ntis:  
• The capacit y and speed  of the com mercial RDBMS product used for th e data 
repository; 
• The speed of the servers on which  Pontis, the  RDBMS, the analytical and 
other processing engines , and ot her information resources ar e installed; 
                                                      
28 Plug -in repo rts and form s may contin ue to be based on Power Builder at the user’s 
discret ion. Th e plu g-in mu st be  capable of handling t his techno logy for the for eseeab le 
future, but not sol ely dependent on i t.

Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
• The effective speed and  congestion levels on the network t hat connect s the 
servers and client machines running the application; and 
• A standalone database engine will cont inue to be necessar y.  Performance 
objectives for the sta ndalone databa se should be comparable.  
Some of these factors may make it impossible to achieve the performance  
requirements for Pontis 5.0 outlined in this section.  However, based on our  
asses smen t of the existing condition of most a gency syste ms and infr astructure, 
we think this outcome is unlikely.   
There are selected lice nsees,  typically  smaller agencies, who may h ave much  
lower powe red comp uter resou rces, and th eir performance must be acceptable as 
well, although not n ecessarily comp arable to larger installations. 
Capacity 
The Pontis 5.0 repository must be  able to store the following qua ntities of 
bridges, work recommendations, scenario s, projects, and us ers at a minimum:

Reliability and Availability 
Pontis 5. 0 is not strictly a tran sactional  application or mission-critical for most  
capabilit ies.  In light of t his, the applic ation shall be availab le for use 18 hours per  
day, 353 da ys per year, reserving 6 hours per day and one day per month for 
routine agency network and infrastructure  maintenance.  During  normal times of 
operation, P ontis shall a chieve 98 percent up time. 
Because Pontis 5.0 is not a mission-critical appl ication, there will be no attempt to  
design or construct the system fo r un interrupted operation.  Agencies may 
choose to i mplement d atabase  transactio n logging, mirroring, or switchover to 
backup servers in the event of a hardwa re or network failure, but su pport fo r 
these decisions or implementation are be yond the scope of Pontis 5. 0 effort.  
Procedures and eq uipment for backups (database and so ftware) and  disaster 
recovery are  also outside the scope of  this effort.

5.4 OPERA TIONA L REQUIREMENTS  
This section outl ines the minimal r equirements for effect ively operatin g Pontis 
5.0.  The r equirements  for both thin-client and thick-client applications are  
discussed.  Specific items are to be  determined .   
The Pontis application server ( ASP.NET) software will  run  on a server  located  
within a (pr esumably) secure fac ility at each agency.  Because it is an ASP.NE T 
application, the end users can vary in  location depending on the network  
accessibility  of the server.  The Pontis database, and any other datab ases to be 
accessed from Pontis may be co-located on the  same server machine, but at a  
minimum must be accessibl e from the Pontis application server via standard  
database co mmunication and conn ection protocols. 
The server machine will run Windows Server 2003 or, g iven technology 
evolution, a descendant target  serv er e nvironment identified in the  
implementation plan.  The server machin e must have all necessary software to 
run an ASP.NET appli cation.  This specifical ly includes, but  may not be limited  
to, IIS30, the .NET Frame work and ASP.NET.  Other web servers, appliances, an d 
add-in technologies may also be necessa ry depending on the final application  
design. 
Back-end server stored procedures and server-side functions will be supported  
and may be assumed to be usable in  the tec hnical design of Pontis 5.0.  This will 
require implementation of the  trigge rs in native DBMS procedural code.  Thi s 
implies that it is very li kely that the server-side code will vary for each target 
DBMS, even if the inte rfaces remain id entical, increasing the development and  
testing effo rt with the significant be nefit of assigning  processing to the 
appropriate application tier(s). 
Pontis 5.0 will be desi gned to be used  with Internet Explo rer; it may work 
correct ly with other browsers bu t th is can not be guaranteed.   G iven the 
predominance of IE in  the browser market, it  does not  app ear to be necessary to 
consider support for other browsers, although this may ne ed to be reconsidered 
if ex ternal customers are running th e app lication(s) and nee d to employ different 
browser technology such as Net scape or Mozilla FireFox . 
Standalone capabilit ies will requi re a workstation running the latest .NET  
Framework, presumably Windows XP Profe ssional (SP2) o r its successor.  Some  
capabilit ies may requir e a network connectio n.  The workstation’s hardware 
requirements will be similar to those of th e existing Pontis 4.4 applicatio n.  There 
                                                      
30The TAG should stron gly consider the need to supp ort HTTP/www servers o ther than 
IIS.  Apache  and its var iants are the mo st widely-used  web se rvers on the net and a rich  
platform to exploit open source capabilities.  However, many agencies rely on IIS, so 
this technolo gy consideration must be resolved as part of  the design . Other  
AASHTOWare products (Trans*port) al ready v ary from the IIS st andard .

will continue to be a standalone/r untim e database engine provided with the 
application for off line work.  The  offlin e dat abase is assumed to be  Sybase  
Adaptive Server Anywhere release 9  or above. 
5.5 INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT  
For a thick-client porti on of Ponti s, an installer program  will be pr ovided to  
install Pontis on the user’s compute r.  The user shall be able to remove Pontis by 
using the Windows Add/Remove  Programs capability.  When necessary, the 
SQL scripts will be p rovided to upgr ade a previo us version o f Pontis database to 
a new version and apply any patches.  The system may be capable of s upporting 
automatic upgrades and  mainten ance fixes using the push te chnology. 
Pontis 5.0 shall be able to coex ist with earlier  versions of  Pontis on the same  
computer. 
5.6 MAINTAINABILITY AND PORTABILITY 
REQUIREMENT S 
Pontis 5.0 sh all comply with AASHTO a pplication development sta ndards based  
on the published recommendations of the AASHTO Technical Applications and 
Architect ure (TA& A) su bcommittee.   
The latest released versions of Mi crosoft tool s includ ing Visual  Studio .NET , 
ASP.NET, .NET Framework, and databases such as Microsoft SQL Server will be 
used.  The actual ve rsions, the database  release version in partic ular, will be 
determined as part of the imple menta tion plan and put under configuration 
manage ment. 
All source code written by the contra ctor will be provid ed to AASHTO, and  
reasonable effort will be  made to develop clearly documented source  code  which 
can be main tained aft er contract by other tha n the original developers. 
All mod ules developed in Pontis 5.0 will supp ort automatic testing except as  
expli citly d istinguished in the technical design.  Every mod ule will be delivere d 
with a testing driver module. 
No commit ment regar ding the po rtability of t he code is made other  than that 
implied by the use of standard Micr osoft .NET tools and well-doc umented third -
party applic ation librari es or frameworks. 
Pontis 5.0 in production is intended to be supported through complete and  
sufficient on-line help and docume ntation and  eq uivalent printed 
documentation, with o ccasional a dditi onal a ssistance  provided through the 
Pontis Support Center.  Pontis 5.0 will al so conti nue to provide field-level help  
where applicable.  As with the existing Pontis  4.x product, it is assumed that  
support will  be provide d by telephone, via e-m ail, and t hrough an on-li ne issues 
tracking sys tem.   
Cambridge Systema tics, Inc. 5-7 
Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
5.7 SECURITY REQUIREMEN TS 
Pontis 5. 0 security is a m ix of database security a nd application security.  Overall 
security is provided by the datab ase and th e Pontis 5.0  user authentication 
mechanisms with more refined security ov er program capabilit ies - e.g. create a 
bridge - being addressed by the app lication.   
It is assumed that authe ntication will ut ilize a single sign-on (SSO) approach and  
application security will be declarativel y managed through database or directory 
entries, rath er than har d-wired into th e application.  This mechanism may have 
implications  for BRIDG EWare/AASHTO Ware generally and will need to b e 
coordinated with the ot her AASHTO products31. 
Database secur ity will need to be insu red for the Ponti s data stor ed in the 
RDBMS; m ost likely th is will  be done by usin g a specifi c username/password 
combination and  running as  particular database roles for each d atabase  
connection.  This securi ty structure  shou ld be similar to the existing security 
approach in Pontis 4.x.  For web client s, care will be taken to i nsure that 
connection information is not accessible from application pages (e.g.,  
userid/password embedded in HTML form va riables).   
The application level sec urity contro ls w ill be c onsistent with current Pontis 4.x 
procedures, except more  comprehensive; no  exceptional controls are required.  A 
specific re quirement addresses field-level data secur ity.   
For normal users, the configura bility of  the s ystem via the interface will be  
limited to changing the parameters  used to pe rform the various analyses and 
modeling functions.  Access to all othe r co nfiguration  parameters, such as  
module access, will be restricted to  Ponti s super users or applicatio n 
administrat ors. 
There are no specific privacy or im munity  (anti virus) requirements for Pontis 5. 0 
identified at  this time. 
5.8 CULTURAL AND POLITICAL REQUIREMENT S 
As there are  no evident  cultural or polit ical application re quirements for Pontis 
5.0, this sect ion of the Functional Req uirements document does not apply for the  
most part.  However, the product li kely will  be designed for  
agency/inte rnational localization from th e gr ound up with respect to user 
interface elements , reports, messa ges, and ot her application attributes where 
native language suppo rt is necessary.  This capability will be usa ble by all  
                                                      
31 Sing le si gn-on technology is an issue that SCOJD and TAA s hould addre ss for a ll 
AASHTOWare product s.  It a ppea rs that Kerbero s is the most  common basis, and 
Microso ft uses  Kerbero s for its Active Directory  Servic es.  Kerberos is also well 
supported by da tabase vendors.

licensing agencies as de sired, on an opti onal ba sis, to customize the ap pearance 
of the product to s uit their internal stand ards.  This capabil ity will  be a nalogous  
to the localization capability of Pon tis 4.4 but more compre hensive in scope.  
5.9 LEGAL REQUIREMENT S 
The syste m shall be capable of export ing the NBI data in the specified NBI 
format as ou tlined in the  NBI guideline.  The system shall be capable supporting 
the future NBI coding guide changes.

6.0 Implementation Plan 
6.1 OVERVIEW  
In order to develop an approximation of th e tot al effort involved and create the  
development plan necessary for proj ect planning, th ree implementation 
alternatives have been identified for consideration by th e BRIDGEWare Task  
Force.  These alternatives are quite diffe rent from each other, particu larly i n 
terms of schedule and user impacts.  Th e alternatives are specified in  terms of  
effort, sched ule, and deliverables. 
Development effort is estimat ed as out lined in section 6.2.  The estimating 
approach provides a sta ndardized mec hanism for estimating the com plexity of 
the effort i nvolved in pro viding  a co mpon ent of Pont is 5.0, which can be 
transformed  into development ho urs or cost .  Based o n the e stimate of 
development effort, t hree alternat ive development app roaches have been 
prepared.  The schedules for Pontis 5.0 are intrinsically l inked to the product’s 
revenue cycles which are directly related to subscribership.  Hence, the schedules  
shown for t he alternati ves reflect availa ble monies and assume no so licitation  
effort will b e undertaken. 
The three alt ernatives proposed for consideration are: 
1. Dedicated Design and Release , where the  entire Ponti s 5.0 product is 
designed, d eveloped, tested, and delive red as a single multi-year effort, with 
an ex plicit cutover to the new versi on at a future point in t ime.  There are no 
interim rele ases or initial pr oducts in this alternative; 
2. Phased Design and Release , where  components of Pontis 5.0 are desi gned,  
developed, tested, and d elivered on a flow basis as a multi-year effort, with  
initial effort s focused on delivering a web based inspection module; and 
3. Dedicated Design an d Phased Release , which varies  from the second 
alternative b y expl icitly calling o ut a dedicated design task that will start and 
conclude before increm ental phased de velopm ent of Ponti s 5.0 component s 
commences.  
Each of these alternati ves is discussed below, with a summary, an outline of 
driving ass umptions, an outline of major development tasks, resou rces, and 
schedule, an d a revenue analysis. 
Note that e ach alternat ive assumes that  the Pontis and Virtis/Opis contractors 
will coord inate throughout the design of Pontis 5.0 and that the Virtis/Opis 
contractor will be f unded outside of the Pontis effort to review Po ntis design 
documents.

Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
6.2 RESOU RCE REQUIREMEN TS ANALY SIS APPRO ACH 
The functional size of Pontis 5. 0 has been estimated using the Common Software  
Measurement Int ernati onal Conso rtium  Full Function Points (COSMIC-FFP) 
method.32  The COSMIC-FFP size scale is ba sed exclusively on Functional User  
Requirements, defined as “the user prac tices and procedures that the  software 
must perform to fulfill the users’ needs.”  Functional user requi rements exclud e 
quality requirements an d any tech nical require ments.  The COSMIC-FFP method  
is designed to work for “data-rich” and “real-time” softwar e, and it provides the 
concepts of software l ayers and tiers to hel p differentiate functional user 
requirements allocated at differe nt levels o f functi onal abstraction.  More 
information on this methodology can be found in Appendix A. 
The COSMIC-FFP meth od results in an e stima te of Cosmi c function size units  
(CFSU).  This estimate is multi plied by a n adjustme nt factor reflecting 
application complexity to obtain “Adjusted CFSU,” and it may then be  scaled as  
appropriate to yield an e stimate in terms of hours or development cost.  The cost 
estimate for Pontis is pre sented in Table 6.1.  Cos ts were calibrated by comparing 
actual development costs to CFSU e stimates for  recent Pontis efforts.  Note that  
the COSMIC-FFP method is not capable of  pro viding an estimate of the cost of 
developing the basic ap plication fra mework an d C++ wrappers, so th ese items  
were estima ted separat ely based on expert judgment. 
Note that t he estimate s provided be low are for the development costs only and  
do not include the cost of design or testin g.  De sign costs are anticipated to be 25 
percent of the development costs,  with an a dditional $25,00 0 for ea ch design  
document produced.  Testing each re lease is ex pected to cost $55,000.

6.3 ALTERNATIVE 1 – DEDICATED  DESIGN A ND 
RELEASE APPROACH  
Overview 
The dedicated design and release approa ch is a strategic option foc used on  
deliver ing a complete p roduct  to e nd users at a single p oint in time , when a 
wholesale cutover will be performe d by agen cies to deploy Pontis 5.0.  The key 
characteristics of this p lan are few er, la rger tasks, a signi ficant initial design 
effort, fewer interim deli verables, a dedica ted te sting phase , and a singl e release, 
resulting in an intense, focused depl oyment effo rt for licensing agencies.  
Driving Assumptions 
The driving assumptions behind thi s approach are: 
1. Agencies d o not want multi ple d eployment efforts in o rder to establish  
Pontis 5. 0 in production, given costs in h ardware, training , staff time,  and 
implementa tion assist ance; 
Cambridge Systema tics, Inc. 6-3 
Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
2. A single large project with a com plete delive rable packa ge is more f ocused  
than a p hased effort with numerous design, develop, and release cycles, 
allowing a dedicated, continuous development team effort; 
3. Changes in technology will be relati vely stable (e.g. the development 
framework will not change radically ov er time, and importantly the work 
done early in the development effort w ill not n eed to be revisited later, and 
possibly o verhauled or  significantly reworked, in response to a technology  
change33);  
4. The entire design and development effort  can be contracted out as a package 
with a fixed price; 
5. The effort can be broken down by contract period to accommodate revenue  
cycles, if necessary; and 
6. Pontis 4.x will continue to be maintai ned throughout the development period  
until all  capabilities ar e delivered,  and at least 2 interim releases may be 
needed to address interim functi onal needs in t he user base.  
Key Deliverables 
The key deliverables for this approach are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
                                                     Prototypes:   Three software prototypes w ill be developed and demonstrated 
to the client as part of the software d esign. 
Design Do cument:  The system  requirements a nd software  design deci sions 
will be doc umented in a detailed design document. 
Pontis 5.0 Alpha Release:   This version of the software will inc orporate all  
the functionality outli ned in the design document, and will be us ed for  
internal testi ng by CS developers. 
Pontis 5.0 Beta Release:  This ve rsion of the software will be released to  
Pontis users for Beta test ing. 
Pontis 5.0 Final Release:   The final version of the software will be re leased to 
Pontis users  no later th an December 2009 . 
Schedule 
The tasks  and schedule for this alternative are presented in Appendix B.  The cost  
estimate is  summarized in Section 6.6. 
 
33 This st able t echnology assumption wa s a key factor in the Virtis/Opis dec ision to focus 
on a COM-b ased approac h, and it has been proven  correct until very recently when  
.NET h as em erged to replace COM .

6.4 ALTERNATIVE 2 – PHASED DESIGN AND RELEASE 
APPROACH  
Overview 
The phased  design and release approach  delivers signif icant comp onents of 
Pontis 5.0 serially ove r time with r olling cycles of design, development, testing, 
and deployment, highl ighted by an initial focus on developing the web 
inspection component.  This approa ch fe atures multiple, less elaborate releases, 
with more user feedba ck contribut ing to the design of later components.  I t 
stresses initi al developm ent of a stab le framework for the product which  persists 
through the several deve lopment cycles.  Th ere is  no “massive” release, but there 
may be significant im pacts from multip le database upgrades, functionality 
releases, or t echnology upgrades. 
Driving Assumptions  
The driving assumptions behind thi s approach are: 
1. Agencies already need  some of the projected components/capabilities of 
Pontis 5.0 earlier,  partic ularly, the web inspection  capabilities and want th em 
expedited; 
2. Agencies ca n accommodate serial, incr ement releases within their ow n IT 
planning schedules; 
3. It is generall y desirable to show results to the use rs earlier; 
4. Phased dev elopment may be somewhat less te chnology dependent in  that 
new technology capabilit ies (e.g. a new .NET Fram ework or web 
development paradigm) can be accommo dated as the project progresses and 
releases components; 
5. Smaller, more focused releases  may offe r additional flex ibility and  
responsiveness to user f eedback; 
6. Pontis 5.0 c omponents are discrete and may be broken out into modular  
releases; 
7. There may  be less risk in modular relea ses, in t hat a chang e of 
direction/emphasis/sc hedule in response to external factors may be  more 
possible; 
8. Design reviews are less  complicated and  more easily accommodated in busy 
manage ment schedules;  
9. Smaller rele ases may map better into product revenue and contracting cycles; 
10. Pontis 4.x will continue to provid e significant BMS f unctionality for users 
until Pontis 5.0 capabilities are delivered; and

11. Pontis 4.x will continue to be maintai ned throughout the development period  
until all capabilities ar e delivered, but no significant interim releases are  
anticipated. 
Key Deliverables 
The key deliverables for this approach are: 
Design Do cuments:  The syste m requirements and softw are design dec isions 
will be doc umented in three design documents – one for each version of 
Pontis. • 
• 
• 
• Pontis 5.0  Release:  This versio n of Ponti s will inco rporate the core  
functionalit y of the  software, as w ell as the  functionality of the I nspection 
module, and it will be available no later than March 2007. 
Pontis 5.1 Release:  This version of the soft ware will  incorpo rate the 
functionalit y of the Project Planni ng and Gateway modules, and it will be  
available no later than  March 2008.  
Pontis 5.2 Release:  This version of the soft ware will  incorpo rate the 
functionalit y of the Pre servation, Pr ogramming, Configuration, a nd Results  
modules, and it will be available no later than April 2010. 
Schedule 
The tasks  and schedule for this alternative are presented in Appendix B.  The cost  
estimate is  summarized in Section 6.6. 
6.5 ALTERNATIVE 3 – DEDICATED  DESIGN A ND 
PHASE D APPRO ACH  
Overview 
This alternative differs from Altern ative 2 by emphasizing  a d edicated design 
effort followed by phased deve lopment of Pontis 5. 0 over tim e.  Th e 
development does not start until the desi gn is completed and approve d.  This  
alternative does emphasize significant pr ototyping efforts intended to ”prove  
out” and demonstrate d esign concepts, which serve to com municate key design 
concepts an d shape expectations ab out th e future product.  There are multiple  
release cycles in this alternativ e, similar to Altern ative 2.  
Driving Assumptions 
The driving assumptions behind thi s approach are: 
1. A dedicated design effort allows for adequate user input and feedback prior 
to development; 
6-6  Cambridge Systema tics, Inc. 
Pontis 5.0   
Functional Requirements Specification v1 .0 
2. As with Alternative 2, phas ed developm ent may b e somewh at less 
technology dependent in that new technology capabilit ies (e.g. a new .NET 
Framework or web development para digm) can be accommodated as the 
project prog resses and releases components; 
3. A phased, multiple release, development process can be accommodated by  
agencies, a s assumed in Alternative 2; 
4. Revenue cycles are a driving factor, and  all the developm ent work must fit 
into current projections; 
5. Pontis 4.x will continue to provid e significant BMS f unctionality for users 
until Pontis 5.0 capabilities are delivered; and 
6. Pontis 4.x will continue to be maintai ned throughout the development period  
until all capabilities ar e delivered, but no significant interim releases are  
anticipated. 
Key Deliverables 
Prototypes:  Three software prototypes will be developed and demonstrated  
to the client as part of the software d esign. • 
• 
• 
• 
• Design Do cument: The system req uirements an d software design decisions 
will be doc umented in a detailed design document . 
Pontis 5.0  Release:  This versio n of Ponti s will inco rporate the core  
functionalit y of the  software, as w ell as the  functionality of the I nspection 
module, and it will be available no l ater than June 2007. 
Pontis 5.1 Release:  This version of the soft ware will  incorpo rate the 
functionalit y of the Project Planni ng and Gateway modules, and it will be

We recomm end that AASHTO  proceed with  Alternative 3 (dedicated design and  
phased rele ase).  This project developm ent strategy aligns well with available  
revenue cycles, allows a formal desi gn review and adjustment s, makes 
significant Pontis 5.0 c omponents such as a web inspection module available 
relatively quick ly after design is co nfirmed and approved.  Further, this  
alternative provides positive feedback  on user ex pectations, and  allows  
adjustment s to incorporate tech nology ev olution during the development period.

6.7 RISK ANALYSI S 
The following are the major risks associated with the Po ntis 5.0 development 
effort: 
Requirement Creep:  There is a ri sk that system require ments will grow 
significantly beyond those conceive d while developing the development cost  
estimate.  T his risk can be managed  by developing a req uirements document  
prior to starting the deve lopment effort. • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• Obsolescen ce: There is a risk that the .NET  standard will become obsolete 
during the product development cycle, or  very soon after the new version of  
Pontis is released.  This risk can be mitigated by adopting a pha sed approach 
to the de sign and/or the development effort. 
Development Cost: There is a risk that t he actual cost of the development  
effort will si gnificantly exceed the estimates. 
Development Schedule: There is a risk that the development effort will take 
significantly longer than scheduled.  This  may affect the license base  if states 
decide to develop their own syst em or move to another syste m. 
Resource R isk: There is a risk that the deve loper will n ot have sufficient  
resources to complete the development, either  because of staff turnover or 
because of a lack of technical experti se. 
Changes to the NBI: There is a  risk that the changes to  the NBI planne d by 
the FHWA will signifi cantly affect the development schedule or inc rease the 
cost of the d evelopment effort. 
Agency Custom Forms: There is a risk that t he approach taken to providing 
agency forms will not support easy migration from Pontis 4.x to Pontis 5.0. 
Maintaining Pontis 4.x:  There is a risk that the cost to maintain Pontis 4.x 
will e xceed budgeted amounts.  This could  happen if there are changes to 
PowerBuild er or Sybase  that require  major revis ions to Pontis 4.x durin g the 
Pontis 5.x development cycle.  This ri sk can be partially mitigated through a 
fixed price maintena nce approach. 
User Satisfaction: There is a risk that t he final  product m ay not meet  user 
expectations, either beca use it does not meet their re quirem ents or because it 
does not conform to their technology st andard s.  This risk can be managed  
through the use of prototypes in the design phas e and by following a phased 
development schedule.

Appendix A – COSMIC-FFP 
Overview 
In the  COSMIC-FFP method, the software to be measured is broken down into  
“functional process types,” defined  as “a n ele mentary component of  a set of  
Functional User Requirements (F UR) comprising a unique cohesive and 
independen tly executable set of dat a movement t ypes.”   
 
 
 
Figure A.1. Generic Flo w of Data Attributes fro m a Functional Perspective35 
Functional process types are broken do wn into four data movement types – 
Entry, Exit, Read, and Write.  Each  data  movement is assu med to include certain 
data manipulations (e.g. data validation) .  Entries and  Exits cross the  boundary 
between the  software be ing measured and its us ers (who may be any person or a  
different software layer or other piece of  softwa re).  A Read moves da ta from

“persistent storage” into the software being measured, while  a Wr ite makes data 
“persistent, ” meaning t hat th e dat a lasts bey ond the life of the functional  
process.  Each instance of data mo veme nt eq uals one CO SMIC Functional Size 
Unit (CFSU).  The size of a function al pr ocess is  the sum of its data movements,  
and the size  of a piece o f software is the sum of the size s of all of its functional 
processes.   
Measuring Pontis 5.0 
Purpose of Measurement 
The purpose of measurement is to measure the size of FUR of Pontis 5.0 as they 
evolve as input to cost estimating an d to the measurement of productivity. 
Scope of Measurement  
The scope of measurement is Po ntis 5. 0, including wor k-output ob tained by 
using existi ng re-usable code. 
Measurement Viewpoint  
The end-user measurement viewpoint allows a functional size to be measured of 
business application software as specified in the Functional User Requirement.

Measuring Mathematical Algorithms 
COSMIC-FFP is not suited for me asur ing complex mathematical a lgorithms, 
which are a  large, inte gral part of Pont is.  To account for this limitation, the 
measurer i s allowed to assign locally -determined functional size to the 
exceptional functionality.   
Below is an example of COSMIC-FFP analysis o n the Multimedia use case.  The  
size of the Multimedia functionalit y is 29 CFSU.
