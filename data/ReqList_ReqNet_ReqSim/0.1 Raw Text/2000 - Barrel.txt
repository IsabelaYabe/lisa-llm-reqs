This document contains a very brief introduction of the functionality of the Coincidence
Matrix(CM),atriggerandreadout ASICusedintheATLASMuonspectrometer.Maintop-ics are general requirements and constraints on the whole design and speciﬁcally on thereadout and trigger blocks of the CM asic.
1.1Purpouse of the document
This document will be used to produce the speciﬁcations and during the design of the Coin-
cidence Matrix. It shall be used also to produce the high level simulation code of the AtlasLVL1 Muon trigger system. It should be read by all people working in the simulation anddesign of the LVL1, LVL2 Barrel µ trigger and Resistive Plate Chambers Readout System.
1.2Scope of the hard ware
The ﬁnal product of the design process, of which this document is part, is the production,
test and installation of about 4000 CMAs, from readout and LVL1 triggering of the ATLASmuon barrel RPC chambers on dedicated boards (CM boards), mounted on the PAD boardsof Resistive Plate Chamber detector of the ATLAS experiment.

113.1.1Requirements on the Readout Blocks
CMA_RO_1Essential, 1, Unstable
The CMA shall retain in “pipeline” memories, during the latency of the LVL1 trigger,information required to monitor the device during standard operation.Information to be readout from the CMA includes:-the data coming from the front-end electronics (pattern of hit strips),-acoarsetimemeasurementsofthetimeofarrivalofthehitwithintheBC,with(1/8ofthe BC period LSB),-the output pattern of the coincidence matrix algorithm,-ﬂags that indicate if the muon candidate is in a region which may be in overlap withanother CMA, separate ﬂags must identify each overlap to the nearby CMA.
Note 1: it has to be decided which output pattern to send, two options are available:
• output pattern of the highest programmed threshold (it will be empty if no candidates pass this
threshold)
• output pattern of the threshold passed by the muon candidate.
CMA_RO_2Essential, 2, Unstable
The size of the pipeline memory shall be ﬁxed, at the maximum latency of 2.5 µs.
Note 1: The TTC signals shall be used to adjust the timing of the L1A signal, to match
the LVL1 buffer lenght (to cope with different effective latencies i.e. TOF, detectorresponse, cables, FE signal preprocessing).Note 2: it could be convenient to perform zero suppression or data compression beforethe derandomizing stage. The pipeline memory could be implemented with FIFOs,given the low occupancy of the detector.Note 3: a discussion on the exact pipeline latency to be implemented has to be done, aconservative assumption is 2.5 µs.
CMA_RO_3Essential, 2, Unstable
For LVL1 selected events, the information discussed in CMA_RO_1 shall be retainedin derandomizing buffer memoriesNote 1: the size of the buffer memories has to be discussed.
CMA_RO_4Essential, 2, Unstable
The CMA will be designed as to be able to transfer readout data serially, onpoint-to-point links.Note 1; readout protocol, is deﬁned in Ref xx.Note 2: the readout protocol should allow for empty frames to be sent even if no inputhits are recorded for a LVL1 trigger, for synchronization.
CMA_RO_5Essential, 1, Stable
Zero suppression shall be applied to the data prior to transmission to the PAD.Note 2: current data bandwidth requirements assume some level of zero suppression.
CMA_RO_6Essential, 1, Unstable

CMA_RO_10Essential, 2, Unstable
Data in the derandomizing buffers shall be tagged with the FE_L1ID and FE_BCIDvalues reconstructed by the TTC system signals.Note 1: the FE_BCID number is a 12 bit number, output of a BC_counter incrementedby the BC signal and reset by the BCR signal. The BCR signal shall be adjusted by theTTC in time to get the correct FE_BCID.Note2:FE_L1IDnumber,outputofaL1ID_Counter,incrementedbytheLVL1_Asig-nal. This FE_L1ID must have a minimum of 9 bit width.
