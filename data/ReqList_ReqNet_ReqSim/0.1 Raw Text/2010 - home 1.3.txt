 DigitalHome Requirements Specification 
1. Introduction 
This document specifies the requirements for the de velopment of a “Smart 
House”, called DigitalHome (DH), by the DigitalHome Owner Division of 
HomeOwner Inc. A “Smart House” is a home management  system that allows 
home residents to easily manage their daily lives b y providing for a lifestyle that 
brings together security, environmental and energy management (temperature, 
humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communic ations. The Smart House 
components consist of household devices (e.g., a he ating and air conditioning 
unit, a security system, and small appliances and l ighting units, etc.), sensors 
and controllers for the devices, communication link s between the components, 
and a computer system, which will manage the compon ents. 
 
The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification  (SRS) is based on the 
DigitalHome Customer Need Statement . It is made up of a list of the principal 
features of the system. This initial version of Dig italHome will be a limited 
prototype version, which will be used by HomeOwner management to make 
business decisions about the future commercial deve lopment of 
DigitalHomeOwner products and services. Hence, the SRS is not intended as a 
comprehensive or complete specification of DigitalH ome requirements. There is 
a supplementary document that provides additional d etail and information about 
the DigitalHome  requirements: the Digital Home Use Case Model  [HO2010]. 
These document were prepared by the DigitalHomeOwne r Division, in 
consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwn er Inc.

3. Overall description 
3.1 Product Description and Scope 
The Digital Home system, for the purposes of this d ocument, is a system that will 
allow a home user to manage devices that control th e environment of a home. 
The user communicates through a personal web page o n the DigitalHome web 
server or on a local home server. The DH web server  communicates, through a 
home wireless gateway device, with the sensor and c ontroller devices in the 
home.  
 
The product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition  
[HLRD 2010] is intended as a prototype, which will allow business decisions to 
be made about future development of a commercial pr oduct. The scope of the 
project will be limited to the management of device s which control temperature, 
humidity, security, and power to small appliances a nd lighting units, through the 
use of a web-ready device. The prototype DH softwar e system will be situated in 
a simulated environment. There will be no actual ph ysical home and all sensors 
and controllers will be simulated. 
 
3.2 Users Description 
3.2.1 DigitalHome Users 
3.2.1.1 The general user shall be able to use the D H system 
capabilities to monitor and control the environment  in his/her 
home. 
3.2.1.2 The general user is familiar with the layou t of his/her home and 
the location of sensor and control devices (for tem perature, for 
humidity, and for power to small appliances and lig hting units). 
3.2.1.3 Although the general user is not familiar w ith the technical 
features of the DH system, he/she is familiar with the use of a 
web interface and can perform simple web operations  (logging 
in and logging out, browsing web pages, and submitt ing 
information and requests via a web interface).  
3.2.1.4 A Master user will be designated, who shall  be able to change 
the configuration of the system. For example, a Mas ter User 
shall be able to add a user account or change the d efault 
parameter settings. He/she will have the same right  as the DH 
Technician, described in section 3.2.2.4. 
3.2.2 DigitalHome Technician 
Digital Home Project, SRS 1.3 Page 6 
 3.2.2.1 A DH Technician is responsible for setting up and maintaining 
the configuration of a DH system. 
3.2.2.2 A DH Technician has experience with the typ e of hardware, 
software, and web services associated with a system  like the 
DH system. 
3.2.2.3 A DH Technician is specially trained by Dig italHomeOwner to be 
familiar with the functionality, architecture, and operation of the 
DH system product.  
3.2.2.4 A DH Technician will have rights beyond the  DH General User, 
capable of setting up and making changes in the con figuration 
of the system (e.g.,setting system parameters and e stablishing 
user accounts), and starting and stopping operation  of the DH 
System. 
3.3 Development Constraints 
3.3.1 The “prototype” version of the DigitalHome Sy stem (as specified in this 
document) must be completed within twelve months of  inception. 
3.3.2 The development team will consist of five eng ineers. The 
DigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management a nd 
communication support. 
3.3.3 The development team will use the development  process specified by 
the Digital HomeOwner Inc. 
3.3.4 Where possible, the DigitalHome project will employ widely used, 
accepted, and available hardware and software techn ology and 
standards, both for product elements and for develo pment tools. See 
section 3.4 for additional detail. 
3.3.5 Because of potential market competition for D igitalHome products, the 
cost of DigitalHome elements (sensors, controllers,  server, tools, etc.), 
for this project should be minimized. As part of th e final project report 
the development team will describe their efforts to  minimize costs, 
including price comparisons between DH elements and  
comparable/competitive elements. 
3.3.6 The DH system will be tested in a simulated e nvironment. There will be 
no actual physical home and all sensors and control lers will be 
simulated. However, the simulated environment will be realistic and 
adhere to the physical properties and constraints o f an actual home 
and to real sensors and controllers. 
3.3.7 Major changes to this document (e.g., changes  in requirements) must 
be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner  Division. 
3.4 Operational Environment
