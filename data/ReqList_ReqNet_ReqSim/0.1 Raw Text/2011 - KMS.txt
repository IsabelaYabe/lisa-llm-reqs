 1.0 Background 
 
The Open Government Memorandum (M- 10-06) of December 8, 2009, commonly known as the 
Open Government Directive, sets an unprecedented standard for a more transparent, 
participatory, and collaborative form of Government. In response to the Directive, OPM has 
established a governance structure comprising members of the Executive Board and their 
respective cross-agency representatives on the Core Team and Component Teams. The 
Component Teams are composed of members from OPM, academia, nonprofits, other agencies 
and the union with the purpose of providing information and ideas to the Core Team. The Core 
Team then synthesizes the information from the Component Teams and makes recommendations 
on implementing Open Government at OPM. All of the teams are developing and implementing 
actions to ensure accountability and a culture that supports the sustainability of transparency, 
participation and collaboration at OPM. 
 
 
 
Specifically, the Knowledge Management System (KMS) is a product from the Flagship Initiative 
Team that was charged with the following:  
 
OPM Knowledge Management System  Requirements 
 
Page 2 
 
 Flagship Initiative  – Knowledge Management and Collaboration Tools – will 
provide easy access to and sharing of agency information (data, policies, 
procedures, processes, and training) for internal and external stakeholders alike, 
wherever they may be working.  Thus, collaborative learning within and outside of 
OPM will be ongoing. 
 
 
2.0 How the Requirements Were Developed 
 
The Flagship Team started the process by requesting requirements documents for the existing 
systems in OPM such as the DMS, the Learning Connect program, Serena Business Mashup 
applications, and the SharePoint pilot project. The requirements documents were analyzed to 
determine what requirements were common to all systems and to develop requirements for the 
KMS to ensure that it integrates all of the existing systems if applicable. 
 
 
3.0 Overview of the Knowledge Management System 
 
This document sets out the requirements for the KMS . We propose redesigning Theo (OPM’s 
intranet) to serve as a portal for the tools that will provide various knowledge management and 
collaboration tools. OPM has several existing knowledge management tools such as Drupal, 
Moodle, Serena Business Mashups. Currently these tools are limited to small groups within OPM. 
Each of these tools has useful features for some knowledge management activities but no single 
tool can fulfill all of the required knowledge management features. Thus, we suggest a federated 
approach in which a redesigned Theo will serve as a common entry point to various knowledge 
management solutions.  
 
The federated approach works much like smartphones and apps. Each knowledge management 
application (current or future) will provide a user-friendly interface accessible through the 
common platform of Theo 2.0 (or, with some apps, integrated into current desktop applications 
such as Microsoft Word). The knowledge management apps (KMA) will also share their data with 
other applications so that existing data sources such as EHRI can be leveraged across several 
applications so as to prevent data redundancy and input errors. How a specific KMA works 
internally can be different from other KMAs but how the KMA shares data and provides the user 
experience will be similar to other KMAs. This streamlines the learning curve and allows for more 
effective integration with OPM’s IT environment.  
 
OPM Knowledge Management System  Requirements 
 
Page 3 
 
 Another advantage of the KMAs is that users can customize their view of Theo 2.0 so that they 
can choose the KMAs that they use. This will increase their productivity as the user can better 
integrate what they need in their particular work processes. Each of the sections below briefly 
describes the various core components of Theo 2.0 that will be provided to all users: 
 
FAQs - OPM established interactive FAQs in 2010 which have proven to be successful with the 
public. We want to expand the use of the FAQs so that they can better serve as an internal 
knowledge resource and provide better stakeholder engagement. 
 
Enhanced Directory  - Along with OPM’s FAQs we currently have an organizational directory 
available on OPM’s public web site. There are plans to enhance the  directory of functional points 
of contact and connect it with the organizational directory. This will also be available internally. 
 
Document Management / Records Management  - The current document management system is 
the DMS which is a stand-alone system. The plan is to replace the existing DMS with a solution 
that will integrate into the document creation workflow. For example, a user will create a Word 
document and then use the new document management system to automatically tag and route 
the document through the appropriate workflow. At the same time, the document will be stored 
in an approved area with an organizationally-approved common naming convention and 
automatically managed in accordance with OPM’s Records Schedule.  
 
Learning Connection  - Learning Connection was introduced in 2011 as an agency-wide training 
platform. It is currently available through Theo. In Theo 2.0 Learning Connection will be expanded 
to support the training necessary to support the communities of practice ( COPs ) in becoming 
collaborative and using Action Learning. 
 
IdeaFactory  - IdeaFactory was introduced in 2011 and will be available through Theo 2.0. Some 
COPs will be formed to collaborate around the more complex ideas introduced through 
IdeaFactory. 
 
Mentor Connect  - Mentor Connect is a planned tool to support OPM’s mentoring program. The 
requirements have yet to be specified but preliminary discussions have called for a tool that 
allows for matching mentors and mentees based on career interests and managing the 
administrative details for mentoring interactions. There will also be features that will support 
online mentoring from mentors external to OPM. 
 
OPM Knowledge Management System  Requirements  
 
Page 4 
 
 Content Management  - The current practice of posting to OPM’s public web site is a long and 
involved process that requires numerous interactions. In Theo 2.0 we will automate the process of 
publishing to the public web  site so that program offices can be more responsive in engaging with 
external stakeholders. The content management system will be accessible through Theo 2.0.  
 
Process Mapping and  Inventory  - Theo 2.0 will support performance management efforts by 
providing a centralized repository where program offices can document  their various business 
processes. We will have COPs that will discover, inventory, and record the business processes for 
discovering best practices and provid ing transparency on OPM’s business practices.  
 
Collaboration Platform for COPs  - A major component of Theo 2.0 will be as an online 
collaboration platform for OPM’s COPs. The tool will allow the C OPs to maintain their documents, 
rosters, and lessons learned. The collaboration platform will also offer online synchronous 
meetings, discussions boards, blogs, and a wiki to contain the body of knowledge created by the 
COP. Theo 2.0’s COPs collaboration platform will support internal and external COPs.

7.0 Additional Requirements for Electronic Document and 
Records Management System 
 
Currently OPM is using a document management system (DMS) to vet and store electronic and/or 
images of paper documents to keep track of the different versions created by different users 
(history tracking) through creating a final version that is then approved by the necessary parties.  
It is not being used as an electronic recordkeeping system. The terms have some overlap with the 
concepts of content management systems but a DMS is often viewed only as a single component 
of enterprise content management within an electronic recordkeeping system.  
 
OPM is seeking to acquire an Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRM) that 
will be used to manage all records regardless of format and location, over the entire record’s 
lifecycle.  The primary recordkeeping functions will include categorizing, locating, identifying and 
controlling record disposition requirements, including e-discovery and management of the 
storage, retrieval, and disposition of the records; regardless of the repository. This type of 
software includes the capabilities of both integrated document management and electronic 
OPM Knowledge Management System  Requirements 
 
Page 12 
 
 recordkeeping. ERM systems commonly provide specialized security and auditing functionality 
tailored to the needs of records managers. Controlling the lifecycle of all records requires 
knowledge of the retention assigned to the record or its components, a required element that the 
DMS does not recognize.  In RM it is important to distinguish the difference between an 
“electronic document management system” and an “electronic recordkeeping system.” An 
example of an electronic document management system is the DMS and OPM's "Team Track" 
used by FOIA to store, share and track information processing ; whereas, an electronic 
recordkeeping system is designed to not only manage documents, it also manages e-mail 
reception, metadata and records creation, identification, storage, accessibility, and integrity of all 
 records, but also the disposition of that information through an electronically integrated records 
retention schedule and electronic tagging mechanism. Many products claim to perform electronic 
records management or integrated document management, but they are not true electronic 
recordkeeping systems unless they meet DoD 5015.2 specifications for electronic records 
management software.  
 
 
8.0 Additional Requirements for Business Analytics and 
Business Intelligence 
 
A major function of the KMS will be the ability to analyze and visualize the data that OPM has in 
various databases, shared drives, and proprietary systems. We have many data systems 
throughout OPM that currently do not share information and thus we are not realizing the 
benefits of tying together disparate data sources to make better-informed decisions. The first step 
is to virtually tie databases together through XML feeds so that we can cut down on data 
redundancy.  
 
The second step is to integrate business analytic tools into the KMS. We have several business 
analytic tools in the agency that we are not currently using to their full potential. For example, 
Microsoft Excel 2007 has a robust set of data analysis and dashboard creation tools that can be 
used for real-time reporting and decision support. Several program offices have SAS that can be 
extended for more effective data mining while other offices possess ArcGIS that can be effective 
geographic analysis of personnel policies. 
 
Once the KMS is implemented and begins to grow, it will produce more data from the various 
applications and information from the COPs. The KMS needs to be scalable which is why we 
advocate a cloud- based platform. We also need to plan for future “Big Data” analysis tools and 
OPM Knowledge Management System  Requirements 
 
Page 13 
 
 support tools when the accumulated data reaches a certain size. We will also have to consider the 
impact of providing APIs and XML feeds on the KMS because these will also impact KMS 
performance. 
 
9.0 Additional Requirements for Migrating Retirement 
Portal 
 
Using RoboHelp, Retirement Services has created an HTML/Javascript portal for their shared 
drive. A separate migration plan should be developed so that all of the content and functionality 
of the Retirement Services portal is transferred to an application in Theo 2. In addition, an analysis 
should be performed to determine whether to keep Retirement Systems existing phpKB 
application or migrate it to another application in Theo 2. 
 
10.0 Funding 
 
The cost benefits of the federated approach is that we leverage the existing systems we have now 
while providing for an effective way of integrating current disparate systems and future 
knowledge management applications. We will also realize savings because sharing between 
databases means fewer database systems to manage and the prevention of data errors due to 
maintaining redundant data systems. The KMS will be funded from the Common Services budget. 
 
 
11.0 Implementation Plan 
 
The implementation of the KMS functionality is the responsibility of the Open Government Team 
and the OCIO (with assistance from OCPL). Each Associate Director and Office Head for the 
organizations listed below is responsible for providing a POC to monitor and coordinate the 
content provided to the various components of the KMS. 
OPM Knowledge Management System  Requirements 
 
Page 14 
 
 12.0 Points of Contact (POCs) 
 
The setup and maintenance of the KMS functionality becomes the responsibility of all 
organizations within OPM under the guidelines established by the Open Government Team with 
the OCIO providing ongoing administrative supervision.  The names of POCs for each organization 
responsible for monitoring, coordinating and updating the database will be provided by Associate 
Directors (ADs) and Office Heads for the organizations listed below:
