1.0 SCOPE 
1.1 Identification 
Minutia Deviation Tool (MDT), version 1.0  (beta) 
 
1.2 System Overview 
The MDT is a prototype Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI) (i.e., software utility) 
that shall aid a user in designating equivalent minutia pairs across two fingerprint biometric 
images and calculating the pai r’s minuti a spatial deviations.   MDT shall serve as a tool to 
support research and analysis of contactless and contact-based fingerprint data.  
 
No prior software development exists for the MDT. 
 
The tool shall be used by biometrics researchers in academia, government, and industry, as 
designated and distributed by the sponsors, in an independent manner without operations or 
maintenance support from the developer.  The MDT version being developed shall be in a Beta 
state, not suitable for general release, but possessing suitable stability for use by knowledgeable 
and experienced researchers. 
 
MDT development is part of the Contactless Fingerprint Research (Phase 2) project.  The effort 
is sponsored by the Director, Defense Biometrics and Forensics in partnership with the National 
Institute of Justice (NIJ). 
 
The MDT is being developed by ManTech Advanced Systems International, Inc. (and its 
subcontractor, Azimuth, Inc.) under the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Sensor, Surveillance, 
and Biometric Technologies (SSBT) Center of Excellence (CoE) cooperative agreement 
(Award# 2010- IJ-CX-K024).  The NIJ SSBT CoE is a center within the National Law 
Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center (NLECTC) System. The Center provides 
scientific and technical support to NIJ’s R&D efforts. The Center also provides technology 
assistance, information, and support to criminal justice agencies. The Center supports the sensor 
and surveillance portfolio and biometrics portfolio. The CoEs are the authoritative resource 
within the NLECTC System for both practitioners and developers in their technology area(s) of 
focus. The primary role of the CoEs is to assist in the transition of law enforcement technology 
from the laboratory into practice by first adopters.  
 
1.3 Document Overview 
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document specifies the required functionality, 
capabilities, computer interfaces, and usability for the MDT.  
 
1.3.1 Thresholds and Objectives 
Each requirement shall have a threshold value or an objective value.  Requirements labeled [T] 
indicate Threshold requirements.  Requirements labeled [O] indicate Objective requirements.

For requirements , “threshold” shall mean the minimum acceptable value that, i n the user's 
judgment, is necessary to satisfy the need. 
 
The “objective” value is the value desired by the user, and the value the software tries to obtain.   
The objective value represents an incremental, operationally meaningful, time-critical, and/or 
cost-effective improvement to the threshold value of software requirements.
