The Change Control pages are used after approval of the original final draft.  They should not be filled in 
while initial and rough drafts are in review.  Their purpose is to record changes through the continuing lifecycle of the software development project.  Often during the design and construction phases additional requirements are uncovered, and in some cases documented requirements are found to be unnecessary or in error.  The SRS should be updated to reflect these changes so that when it is mapped to test plans and procedures they are correct according to the latest agreements between the project development team and the end customer. All changes will be documented here.

System Requirements Specification  1 FINAL – Revision 0   1. INTRODUCTION 
The Statewide Design and Engineering Services Division (Division) of the 
Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (Department) of the State of Alaska is responsible for the design of State and federally funded highways and airports.  Inherent in this process is the acquisition and management of real property.  The Division has initiated a project to review and improve the way it conducts rights of way activities.  They have engaged Professional Growth Systems (PGS), a management-consulting firm, to assist in documenting and redesigning existing processes.  They have engaged Wostmann & Associates, Inc. and their subcontractor, 7X Group, LLC, to perform systems analysis and document requirements for software to support the new processes.  To provide a foundation for that clarity, formatting of this document is in accordance to the ANSI/IEEE STD-830-1998
1 standard tailored to the needs of the Department. 
1.1 Purpose 
This document is one of a series of requirement specifications for software to facilitate the acquisition and management of highways (including federal-authorized highways), airports, and public facilities.  It is intended to capture requirements that must be embodied in the system to be constructed.  This document will be used by the Division, end users, the Department’s IT group, and contract systems developers to validate that all requirements for the system are clear and well understood.   
The requirements described in this specific document will be the basis for 
subsequent design and development of an automated Project Development System for Right of Way (ROW) sections. 
1.2 Scope  
The Project Development SRS encompasses all major groups in the ROW process including: 
• Plan Preparation 
• Pre-Audit 
• Appraisal 
• Acquisitions

Specifications , ANSI/IEEE Standard 830-1998, New York, 1998. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  2 FINAL – Revision 0   • Relocation 
• Property Management. 
Projects and their associated parcel appraisals and acquisitions will be tracked 
with a workflow system and individual work queues for employees and/or selected contractors.  The system will include existing databases, such as the Management Reporting System (MRS) and will have interfaces for bi-directional data exchange. 
This system will be developed in parallel with the automation of the Permit 
System.  While both systems will share common software architecture as defined by the Department Information Technology group, they will operate independently.

 PGS Revision Flows 
1.5 Overview 
7x Group, LLC, Wostmann & Associates, and PGS developed a hybrid approach 
to a Joint Modeling Session (JMS) to facilitate the gathering of information from the clients.  This approach allows for the rapid collection of information by introducing limited Object Oriented (OO) concepts.  The Department Subject Matter Experts (SME) were introduced to OO concepts at the beginning of the 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  8 FINAL – Revision 0   session.  Before the meeting, the SRS team developed a series of class cards to 
facilitate discussion during the JMS. 
The following sections of this document describe the requirements for the system, 
both from the external perspective of end users and interfacing systems, and from the internal perspective of functional requirements and behaviors necessary to support the external interfaces. 
The application development process is organized into the following stages: 
1) Joint Modeling Sessions (JMS) between end users and developers that 
facilitate the discovery of information pertaining to business operations in a real world and how those would be facilitated in a theoretical world (redesigned process flow).  The process flow document produced by PGS generates the initial document set in the Modeling sessions.  The Subject Matter Experts (SME) then refine this document set to determine the successful capture of all the rules.  
2) Analysts then take the JMS information and prepare the functional 
requirements of the SRS by identifying all aspects of the application with Application Flow by extrapolating the JMS information into a real-world set of requirements.   
3) During review meetings with each of the three regions, a matrix of 
requirements and interfaces was developed.  Each region independently rated the applicability and need of the function or interface for their region.  In a joint meeting with the ROW Chiefs and HQ Management, the composite matrix was reviewed and approved.  This matrix has been included as Table 1. 
4) Clients review the draft SRS, allowing for comments and changes to 
take place to refine and capture all the correct requirements.  Since this SRS document will be the basis for the many design phases of various related rights of way systems collectively called Project Development, this document should be viewed as progressive and information identified during later analysis may be added into this document as the detailed design of the Project Development system evolves. 
Periodic review of the accomplishments of each project stage will help to 
determine other areas of the operations in need of refinement or clarification.  This “continuous” improvement process will ensure that we are consistent in the identification of all requirements. 
We are engaging in this effort to ensure that a methodical and repeatable approach 
to the software development cycle at the Department is maintainable and consistent from project to project.  The SRS structure allows us to give due-
 
  
System Requirements Specification  9 FINAL – Revision 0   diligence to analyze needs and requirements and provides a solid framework 
within which to develop long-term, scalable applications that will grow with the organization.  This produces an application built with solid constructs to facilitate future development efforts.  It is also an attempt to solidify the development process in a grounded structure that has demonstrably performed in other efforts and allows for a reusability of concepts and methods with future projects.

System Requirements Specification  12 FINAL – Revision 0   2. GENERAL SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION 
 
2.1 Product Perspective 
The Project Development application described in this SRS is a business system 
designed to manage and track the acquisition of real property related to the design and construction of highways and airports.  The system will be accessible by Department employees throughout the ROW group in order to enter, monitor, track, review, and manage ROW projects. 
Project Development is one of two major development efforts of the RROWDyS 
automation efforts for the Department's ROW section.  The other is the Permit System for ROW.  At the heart of the Project Development system will be a Workflow component that will automate the movement of projects between the various ROW groups and into the next participant's Work Queue.  The Work Queue functions as a person's electronic in-basket.  The Workflow process will allow supervisors to quickly track or find projects as they move through the ROW certification process. 
The Project Development system will use the Department LAN.  It may have the 
ability to interface with the systems of other agencies and departments via the State WAN.  The State WAN provides a gateway to the Internet that will allow connectivity to contractors doing ROW work on behalf of the Department. 
2.1.1 System Interfaces 
 
2.1.1.1 MRS - Management Reporting System 
This system is currently in use by the Department, including ROW, to capture 
varied data about all projects.  It uses an ORACLE database and will be a primary source and recipient of information with the Project Development system.   The Management and Reporting System (MRS) does not contain financial data.  AKSAS is queried for financial data and downloaded into MRS. 
2.1.1.2 User Authentication System 
The Department’s IT group maintains an LDAP server with entries for all 
Department employees.  The permitting system will use the LDAP server to authenticate internal Department users, and to retrieve user information such as 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  13 FINAL – Revision 0   email address and group membership.  The group membership will be used to 
determine the user's role, for example permitting agent or reviewer. 
2.1.1.3 AKSAS   
The State of Alaska accounting system, while containing financial data for the 
Department, is not anticipated as being used with a direct network interface. 
 
2.1.1.3.1 Geneva 
This tool is used as a reporting mechanism using AKSAS. 
2.1.2 User Interfaces 
The Project Development system will have various interfaces for different groups 
of users.  While the appearance of the user interface may be similar, the functionality of each user interface will be distinct, based on the normal work environment and functions. 
The user interface classes will be for both DOT ROW employees and their 
authorized contractors and will include the following disciplines: 
• Plan Preparation 
• Pre-Audit 
• Appraisal 
• Acquisitions 
• Relocation 
• Property Management

Project locations can be referenced by the following: 
• From and To State Mile Point/Post 
• HAS (Highway Analysis System) - Road Log 
• Latitude/Longitude 
• GPS (Global Positioning System) 
• Other Geographical references (descriptions of at least 20 
characters) 
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies 
It is anticipated that a number of electronic documents and images will be associated with each project.  To provide adequate response times for the ROW users, it is likely that both the existing WAN and LAN bandwidth and/or server size and locations may need to be changed.  This is particularly relevant for the Central and Northern Regions, since the existing servers are located in Juneau.

Figure 12:  Pre-Audit Process Overview 
 
3.2.8.1 Receive Notice of Request 
The Pre-Audit staff receives a request notice from the system for an estimate & Project Development Authorization (PDA) for ROW incidental work in Design Phase 2 and Phase 3 funding for the Authority to Appraise and Acquire from the Design Project Manager.  Initiation of a project database file is completed by entering AKSAS number, Federal Project number, Design Project Manager, Pre-audit Team assignments, and any other pertinent information. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  59 FINAL – Revision 0   3.2.8.2 Receive and Review ROW Plans 
Pre-Audit receives the completed ROW plans and the system notifies Pre-Audit to 
initiate Phase 3 Authorization to Proceed (ATP)/funding request. 
3.2.8.3 Prepare Cost Estimate (Scope, Schedule, and Budget) 
This function prompts Pre-Audit to prepare a cost estimate and submit it to the 
Design Project Manager.  Engineering submits costs for number of parcels, worker hours, number of sheets for ROW plans, number of parcel plats, etc.  Appraisal submits analysis by parcel of costs to acquire ROW and worker hours/contract costs.  Acquisitions submits worker hours and contract costs for acquisition and/or condemnation.  Relocations submits costs for relocation of property, as well as worker hours.  Property Management submits costs for demolition, removal, and management of property including worker hours required.  Pre-Audit determines and estimates the worker hours through project closeout based on the  data provided to the system from these other areas, Pre-Audit estimates the worker hours through the closeout of the project.   
3.2.8.4 Approval of Cost Estimate 
This function submits the cost estimate to Pre-Audit and the ROW Chief for 
approval.  The ROW Chief approves the ROW estimate prior to submittal to the Design Project Manager.  Once approved, the Cost Estimate is submitted to the Design Project Manager/Project Agent.  If cost estimate is not approved, Pre-Audit is automatically notified to redo and resubmit.   
3.2.8.5 Database Monitoring/Entry 
The Database Monitoring/Entry function will monitor the various databases to 
track the status of funding requests.  Pre-Audit will then update the status in the comment section of the database. 
3.2.8.6 Project Development Authorization (PDA) 
Pre-Audit receives the approved Project Development Authorization (PDA) and 
Authority to Proceed (ATP) for FHWA projects.  Pre-Audit will then input the data into a database and file along with getting the PDA and ATP into project file in the system. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  60 FINAL – Revision 0   3.2.8.7 Notification 
The Notification function lets Pre-Audit notify the functional groups via the 
system that the Authority to Proceed (ATP) and funding has been received.  Pre-Audit then submits notice to the functional groups with the authority to proceed. 
3.2.8.8 Contractor Award Notification 
The Contractor Award Notification function is used to set up the contractor in the 
system (should be used to get the information for the independent contracts in the system).  Each group that requests the activities of the contract placement should establish them in the system when contracts are awarded and the system will notify Pre-Audit of awarded contract in order to encumber required funds. 
3.2.8.9 Obligations with Encumbrances 
After receiving funding, Pre-Audit determines if there are obligations that require 
encumbrances.  If there are obligations that require encumbrances, Pre-Audit requests, receives, and approves Professional Services Contract, Stock Requests, Approved Appraisal Review Estimates, anticipated obligations for legal fees, and anticipated obligations for relocation and property management fees.  This system function will provide a checklist for Pre-Audit to determine obligations that require encumbrances. 
3.2.8.10 Funding AKSAS Sufficient 
After receiving all necessary documents, Pre-Audit determines if the AKSAS 
funding is sufficient to cover project costs.  If the funding is not sufficient, Pre-Audit requests via the system that the cost estimate be revised and resubmitted.  If the funding is sufficient, Pre-Audit prepares and submits via the system a notice to Finance to encumber the funds.   
3.2.8.11 Notification of Encumbered Funds 
The Notification of Encumbered Funds function notifies Finance of the need to 
encumber funds.  If it is determined that no obligations require encumbrances, Finance submits a notification via the system to Pre-Audit. 
3.2.8.12 Request for Payment 
Once Pre-Audit receives notification that the funds are encumbered, Pre-Audit 
receives requests for payment via the system.  Determination is made if it is a Contract Payment, Acquisition Payment, Condemnation Payment, Relocation Payment, or an invoice payment. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  61 FINAL – Revision 0   3.2.8.13 Code Funds 
The Code Funds function will automate the coding process by providing 
checklists for each type of payment and all necessary forms.  If it is a Contract Payment, Pre-Audit pulls up the files via the system, reviews the contract, makes any necessary coding corrections to the contract, confirms payment authorization and completes the database input form.  If it is an Acquisition Payment or a Condemnation Payment, Pre-Audit pulls up all acquisition related files, completes a parcel review form, completes database input form, completes transmittal checklist form, reviews transmittal documents and completes transmitted checklist.  If it is a Relocation Payment, Pre-Audit pulls acquisition and relocation files, completes relocation/parcel review form, completes relocation checklist form, determines relocation claim type, review transmitted documents and completes checklist.  If it is not a Contract, Acquisition, Condemnation or Relocation Payment, then it is an invoice payment, in which case Pre-Audit determines the type of invoice and/or financial obligation.   
Pre-Audit determines if payment is eligible for Federal participation.  If the 
payment is not eligible for federal participation, Pre-Audit codes the payment to non-participating funds.  If the payment is eligible for federal funds, the payment is coded for participating funds. 
3.2.8.14 Review Budget/Request Additional Funds 
The Review Budget/Request Additional Funds function will automate the budget 
review process.  After coding, the system determines if the funding is sufficient.  If the funding is not sufficient, Pre-Audit accesses the system to review the budget, reviews all current authorized estimates, review current expenditures on AKSAS, and revise authorization to meet current/anticipated expenditures.  Pre-Audit inputs revised data into the cost estimate via the Design Project Manager to the Project Control and submits a request for additional funds. 
3.2.8.15 Data Entry 
After funding is sufficient, Pre-Audit inputs all data into the system for tracking, 
reporting, and queries. 
3.2.8.16 Purchase Voucher 
After all information is captured in the system, this function will route the 
purchase voucher and agreement documentation to the ROW Chief for signature approval.  If the Chief does not approve, notification is sent back to Pre-Audit for additional information and corrections. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  62 FINAL – Revision 0   3.2.8.17 Invoicing 
If it is an acquisition/relocation payment, Pre-Audit forwards the invoice to 
Finance with a request for a return warrant to Pre-Audit. 
If it is not an acquisition/relocation payment, Pre-Audit forwards approved 
invoice to Finance for payment and the process is complete. 
3.2.8.18 Return Warrant 
Pre-Audit receives the warrant from Finance and Pre-Audit determines if it is an 
acquisition warrant.  If it is not an acquisition warrant, Pre-Audit mails the warrant and signed relocation claim documents to the payee with a return receipt request. 
Only acquisition and relocations payments are return warrants.  Other invoice 
payments are mailed directly from the Department of Administration in Juneau. 
3.2.8.19 Return Receipt 
The return receipt function will track the receipt of the return receipt in the 
system.  Once the return receipt is received and filed, the payment process is complete.  If it is an acquisition warrant, the Pre-Audit supervisor records documents, mails warrants, and signed acquisition documents to payee with return receipt request.  Once the return receipt is received and filed, the system notifies relocations and property management supervisors of date of property owner receipt of payment.  Upon notification, the payment process is complete. 
3.2.8.20 Notification of Revenue Payment 
This function will notify Pre-Audit of Revenue payment. 
3.2.8.21 Code Revenue 
Pre-Audit determines if payment is project related.  If the revenue is not project 
related, Pre-Audit codes it in the system as unrestricted.  If the revenue is project related, Pre-Audit codes it for that particular project in the system.  Pre-Audit inputs the revenue into the database and the system notifies Finance. 
3.2.8.22 Project Closeout list 
The ROW Chief or Engineering Supervisor notifies Pre-Audit of certification and 
Pre-Audit adds the project to the closeout list. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  63 FINAL – Revision 0   3.2.8.23 Remaining ROW Activities 
Once the project is added to the closeout list, Pre-Audit determines if all ROW 
activities are complete.  The system will provide a checklist of all ROW activity, and if not complete, Pre-Audit continues to track the activities.  This function provides Pre-Audit with a completion checklist. 
3.2.8.24 Financial Reconciliation 
If all ROW activities are complete, Pre-Audit reviews conveyance documents and 
plans then performs financial reconciliation.  This includes pulling ROW Plans, pulling parcel files and core documents, confirming all ROW Unit Supervisors concur in closure of project, confirming Last Resort Housing (LRH) loans are paid in full and reviews ROW Plans with conveyance documents. 
Pre-Audit determines if ROW Plans and conveyance documents reconcile.  If the 
ROW Plans and conveyance documents did not reconcile, Pre-Audit obtains required corrections and reconciles ROW Plans and conveyance documents again. 
Once the ROW Plans and conveyance documents reconcile Pre-Audit reviews and 
totals account code costs and compares totals with AKSAS.  Pre-Audit determines if account code costs and AKSAS records reconcile.  If account code costs and AKSAS do not reconcile, Pre-Audit researches the difference and requests the necessary corrections. 
3.2.8.25 Summary Spreadsheet 
Once account code costs and AKSAS reconcile, the system prepares a summary 
spreadsheet for Pre-Audit.  
3.2.8.26 Project Closeout  
Once the summary spreadsheet is complete, Pre-Audit prepares and distributes via 
the system a closeout memo and submits a signed Project Completion Form to Project Control. 
3.3 Performance Requirements 
There are no specific performance requirements identified. 
3.4 Logical Database Requirements 
No logical database requirements have been identified. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  64 FINAL – Revision 0   3.4.1 Conversion Requirements 
 
3.4.1.1 Sisyphus Parcel Management System (PMS) 
This system will be used primarily to extract information from projects currently 
in process at the time of cutover to the new Project Development System.  It is written in Microsoft Access and is used by Pre-Audit to track project and parcel-related expenditures and revenues, condemnation cases and Professional Service Agreements.  
The reports currently generated in Sisyphus will need to be duplicated in the new 
Project Development system. 
3.5 Design Constraints 
 
3.5.1 Database 
The standard database for Department systems is Oracle running on Unix servers.  Oracle provides a robust and scalable relational database management system capability.  The application system specified by this SRS shall be implemented using Oracle as its database. 
3.5.2 Application Architecture 
The Department has defined a systems architecture that utilizes: 
1. Oracle as its database, 2. An application server (where most of the business logic resides), and 3. CORBA middleware (providing an interface to the application server). 
Contractors have access to the system via the web, while DOT employees have 
access to the system via Java applications on their DOT computers.  Both the web interface and the Java application interface communicate with the applications server via the CORBA interface in order to provide consistent access control, monitoring, and problem notification. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  65 FINAL – Revision 0   3.5.3 Development Language 
While other language can be used with a CORBA application architecture, the 
Java language is in common use.  A significant number of programmers have experience with the Java language, it has object oriented features which contribute to building reliable software, a large number of third party vendors provide tools which interface with Java, and it runs on both the Department’s Unix servers and on Windows workstations. 
3.5.4 Web Server 
The Department’s preferred web server for implementing secure, encrypted systems is Netscape Enterprise server.  
3.5.5 LDAP User Authentication 
The Department uses an LDAP server to provide user ID and password authentication for applications.  The Right of Way project development application shall use the LDAP server to authenticate user IDs if authentication is needed. 
In addition, the LDAP server associates users with groups and privilege.  The user 
authorizations should be done through the LDAP mechanism.  Email addresses for users should also be retrieved from this service, rather than storing them separately in an application database. 
3.6 Software System Attributes 
 
3.6.1 Reliability Requirements 
No reliability requirements have been identified. 
3.6.2 Availability Requirements 
No availability requirements have been identified. 
3.6.3 Security Requirements 
 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  66 FINAL – Revision 0   3.6.3.1 Browser Interface Security 
Since contractor personnel will be using the Project Development system outside 
of the Department LAN to enter sensitive data, the data streams should be encrypted.  
3.6.4 Maintainability Attributes 
Maintainability attributes to consider include the distribution of users (both employee and non-employee) and the possible implications for statewide installation and maintenance.  These would be considerations about whether the Department user interface can, should, or must be a web application, or a client executable. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  67 FINAL – Revision 0   4.  APPENDIX 
 
4.1 Plan Preparation Joint Modeling Session Discussion Notes, 
Actors, Stories 
 
Modifications suggested during the review of the DRAFT version of the SRS will be 
added in italics to preserve the original notes or if deletions are requested, they will be 
shown by strikethrough . 
4.1.1 Discussion Notes 
 
1. Title 
1.1. Project person is assigned in Title.  1.2. Title is a separate function in SE 1.3. Projects can be separated from title work 1.4. There may be a possibility that Title  
1.4.1. ROW Engineer tells title what they need to get. 
1.5. Preliminary Title 
1.5.1. Corridor – PLSS – Query PLSS to identify which parcels in a corridor will be affected by 
this request. 
1.5.2. There is no notion of Parcels at this point – only a corridor. 1.5.3. Title gives us the information of the parcels based upon the Corridor. 1.5.4. Preliminary title information is put in the system by external contractors – hardcopy 
received by the system. 
1.5.4.1. Finite staffing in the departments precludes not having the contractors on the 
discussions. 
1.5.5. Title Database internal to the system – possibly linked to the Recorders Office 
1.6. Don’t send information to project supervisor – other – send it to project team.  (Central 
Region only)   
1.7. Appraisal Driven Parcel changes 
1.7.1. May be driven by all design or they may also be changes not required for discussion with 
design. 
1.7.2. Design controls the budget – land acquisitions cover the majority of the cost – not Plan 
Preparation. 
1.7.3. Funding sufficiency is based upon the Appraisal portion. 1.7.4. ROW engineering does not determine budget sufficiency. 1.7.5. The Plan Prep people currently do discuss changes with the DPM for evaluation of 
budgetary concerns. 
1.7.6. ROW engineering Supervisor makes the budgetary changes (and assessments as to if the 
change will occur in the budget) – Litigation and condemnation of properties. 
1.7.7. Budget Review goes across all the system.  All Team Members… 1.7.8. ROW Engineering from an appraisal standpoint or from a budget standpoint to determine 
whether monies are available to proceed.  Can they design around the issue or do they need to proceed with construction.  
2. Appraiser actually calls the problems to attention 3. Project team determines – query the appropriate team members.  4. Decisions made at a budgetary level should be made by the Design Project Manager or the ROW Chief.  
Are parcel changes warranted?  (ROW Chief justifies changes or should the ROW Engineer make the 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  68 FINAL – Revision 0   first determination and they pass on recommendations to the ROW Chief?)  – Can they elevate the 
adjustments to Design?  – Can they request a design change (evaluate and explore design changes)? 
5. Do we want to make slope limit changes to the original design?  If yes, then the designer will make the 
changes otherwise, it may just be elevated to the ROW Chief. 
6. Do you want to request design changes or make them yourself?  -  (Cost effective to ask the question? – 
cost justified?) 
7. Delegated to the ROW Engineer to make certain cost justification changes.  (They will not be relevant) 8. Pre-Audit and Chief may be notified if there is insufficient funding or major changes to the design, 
which will affect design changes. 
9. 148 and 150 changes for the implementation issues – looping is not necessary potentially (review with 
group when we get to this point).

2.2.3.2. Is this something that is required?  (Looks like it) 2.2.3.3. Transmitted to them routinely 
2.2.4. Budget – potential interface to MRS (Internal system) – Management Reporting System 
(ORACLE) (MRS does not contain financial info…it queries AKSAS for budgetary info.  
The Internet site is only one means to update portions - certain fields within the ORACLE database.  The Internet form is geared toward just the Project Status Application Production, i.e. Design Status Report.        
           We have multiple methods that we use to input information into the MRS database.  
Controls are placed on the ORACLE tables so people can't update using front-ends such as MS ACCESS or EXCEL.  In Northern Region, we primarily are using MS ACCESS as a front-end to viewing, querying, reporting from the ORACLE database.  Ultimately all input, regardless from where, the web, MS ACCESS, etc. all feeds back to the ORACLE database.  ORACLE/MRS downloads nightly in phases from AKSAS for budgetary info.    
2.2.4.1. Contains all information related to Coding (ledger, project id, federal id etc). 2.2.4.2. MRS will not be replaced by this system (although it may be populated by this 
system) 
2.2.4.3. MRS provides information to them currently (Balance, Expended and 
Encumbered)

System Requirements Specification  86 FINAL – Revision 0   4.1.3 Plan Preparation Story 
 
The Right of Way (ROW) Engineer ing (Eng.) Supervisor receives a starter kit (ROW project) from a 
Design Project Manager (DPM).  The ROW Eng. Supervisor requests the ROW Chief to assign the ROW Project Supervisor/ Agent.  The ROW Eng. Supervisor assigns the ROW project to a ROW Eng.  The ROW 
Eng. Reviews the ROW project to determine if additional information is needed from the DPM.  If additional information is needed the ROW Eng. requests and receives the information from the DPM.  Once the additional information is received, the ROW Eng. checks for missing data again.   
 
If all information needed is present, the ROW Eng. determines if a level one survey is available.  If a level one survey is not available or it is inadequate, survey is requested to perform or augment a level one survey.  The level one survey is scheduled.  When the level one survey is complete, the ROW Eng. notifies the ROW Eng. Supervisor and title to proceed.  The ROW Eng. Supervisor assigns the project to title.  Title performs a preliminary research on land status.  The research consists of determining which properties are affected by acquiring and reviewing the MTP, USS, 14(c), rect., plats, subdivision plats and quad maps.  Once the title research is complete, the ROW Eng. Supervisor establishes the scope, schedule, and budget of the project.  The ROW Eng. Supervisor transmits the scope, schedule, and budget to Pre-Audit for compiling SSB from 
other ROW disciplines. Then Pre-Audit becomes point of contact for budget information that Pre-Audit forwards to  DPM.  The ROW Eng. determines if funding is sufficient.  If the funding is not sufficient, the 
ROW Eng. notifies the DPM.  When the funding is sufficient, the Row Eng. Supervisor determines if staff is available.  If staff is not available, the ROW Eng. Supervisor decides if an External (Ext.) ROW Eng. Consultant is going to be used.    If an Ext ernal  ROW Eng. Supervisor is not going to be used the ROW project is sent back to the ROW 
Eng. Supervisor for scooping, scheduling, and budget.  If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant is going to be used, procurement does consultant procurement.  The ROW Eng. Supervisor determines if the procurement process was successful.  If the procurement was not successful, the process flow goes to where the ROW Eng. Supervisor establishes the scope schedule and budget.  If the procurement process was successful, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant submits research documents.  The ROW Eng. determines if the research documents are acceptable.  If the research documents are not acceptable, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits the research documents.    Once the research documents are acceptable the Ext. ROW.  Eng. Consultant submits the progress report with staff hours.  The ROW Eng. determines if the progress report is acceptable.  If the progress report was not acceptable, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits the progress report.     Once the progress report is accepted the Ext. ROW Consultant submits a 25% ROW Corridor (both electronic and paper).  The ROW Eng. determines if the 25% ROW Corridor is acceptable.  If the 25% ROW Corridor was not acceptable the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits the 25% ROW Corridor.     Once the 25% ROW Corridor is accepted the Ext. ROW Consultant submits the base maps and survey report.  The ROW Eng. determines if the base maps and survey report is acceptable.  If the base maps and survey report was not acceptable the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits the base maps and survey report.     Once the base maps and survey report is accepted the Ext. ROW Consultant submits preliminary parcel design.  The ROW Eng. determines if the preliminary parcel design is acceptable.  If the preliminary parcel 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  87 FINAL – Revision 0   design was not acceptable, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits the preliminary parcel 
design.  After all phases of the Ext. ROW Eng. Contract are accepted, title orders the reports.   If staff is available, a determination is made as to whether staff is available to do a detailed title search.  If staff is not available to do a detailed title search, one is ordered.  If staff is available, title does a detailed title research that includes researching local government tax records, subscription databases, recorder’ office, title company records, DOT records, other governmental records (BLM/DNR/BIA/CED/Forrest Service) and court documents.    Once the detailed title research is done/received, it is put into a database.  Title then develops a list of owners within the ROW project limits and transmits it to the ROW Eng. Supervisor, DPM, and survey.  Survey then notifies property owners for survey via letter.  ROW Eng. obtains any existing/additional aerial photos from design.  ROW Eng. determines if an additional level one survey is needed.  If a level one survey is needed the ROW Eng. computes the corner search, writes and sends survey instructions to survey and gets a reply from survey.  ROW Eng. Supervisor develops work plan for base mapping by making staff assignments, determining scale and sheet layout and reviewing base map portion of schedule.  ROW Eng. prepared base maps by computing base maps, drawing base maps to current standards, applying applicable PLOs, entering notes of decisions made and Quality 
Control ( QC) for accuracy.  The ROW Eng. transmits ROW base maps to DPM and ROW Eng. Supervisor. 
 The ROW Eng. Supervisor decides whether to record base maps.  The ROW Eng. Supervisor determines if the record of survey is adequate.  If the record of survey is not adequate, it is returned to the ROW Eng. for rework.  If the record of survey is adequate, the ROW Eng. transmits the record of survey to title and orders a recording.  Title records the base maps as a record of survey.  Once the recording of base maps is done the ROW Eng. requests and receives a ROW needs from DPM.  The ROW needs consists of an electronic document of slope limits, centerline, minimum ROW limits, hardcopy of project centerline, design drawing set and topographical drawing from survey locations.  Then the ROW Eng. develops a preliminary parcel design that includes assigning numbers to parcels and a parcel list, which is transmitted to title.  Title orders reports after receiving the documents from the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant or from the internal process.  Title determines it the title documents are to be prepared by a title consultant.  If the title report is to be prepared by a title consultant, the consultant is procured via a set fee.  Title provides information to the title consultant.  The title consultant prepares and delivers a title report.  Title determines if the title report is adequate.  If the title report is not adequate, the title consultant is required to redo the title report.  If the title report is adequate, the title report is delivered to the ROW Eng.  If a title consultant will not prepare the title report, then title prepares the title report and delivers the title report to the ROW Eng.  After the ROW Eng. reviews the title report, the title report is delivered to the ROW Eng. Supervisor.  The ROW Eng. Supervisor determines if staff is available to prepare the ROW plans.  If staff is available, the ROW Eng. evaluates the report, requests a level two survey, finalizes the parcel design and draws the ROW Plans, which consists of computing parcel dimensions and areas along with inputting access and utility easements per the title report.  If staff is not available, the ROW Eng. Supervisor decides if the schedule should be changed.  If the schedule is to be changed, the ROW Eng. changes the schedule and then determines if staff will be available again.  If the ROW Eng. Supervisor decides not to change the schedule, he/she decides if a contract is in place.  If a contract is not in place then the contract loop is redone.  If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant contract is in 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  88 FINAL – Revision 0   place, the ROW Eng. Supervisor provides the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant with the title reports.  The Ext. 
ROW Eng. Consultant provides the ROW plans to the ROW Eng. for review.  The ROW Eng. reviews the ROW plans and determines if revisions are needed.  If revisions are needed the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and returns the ROW plans for review by the ROW Eng.  When the ROW plans are deemed acceptable, the ROW Eng. transmits the ROW plans to the ROW Eng. Supervisor.  The ROW Eng. transmits the ROW plans to the other ROW sections.  If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant was used, they are notified of a “plans in hand” inspection date.  The ROW Eng. performs a “plan in hand” inspection.  The ROW Eng. checks with the DPM if slope limit s or centerline was changed.  If there was a 
change then the ROW Eng. determines if an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant was used.  If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant was used, they submit a set of revised plans to the ROW Eng, who determines if the plans are acceptable.  If the plans are not acceptable, they are revised by the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant and resubmitted.  If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant did not do the ROW Plans, the ROW Eng. determines if an additional field survey is required.  If an additional field survey is required, a level three survey is requested.  Either way the ROW Engineer revises the ROW plan.  Once the ROW Eng. receives the revised plans, they transmit the parcel information to the appraisal supervisor and other sections.  Then the ROW Eng. Supervisor prepares the ROW Engineering estimate, which consists of putting together a cost estimate spreadsheet and submitting the cost estimate to pre-audit  
for Phase2 Design and 3 ROW costs .  Then the ROW Eng. Supervisor transmits the ROW plans to FHWA.  
Receive phase 3  authority to appraise and acquire on all federal highway projects that include acquisition. 
 If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant was engaged to complete the parcel plats the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant submits the draft parcel plats to the ROW Eng.  The ROW Eng. reviews the parcel plats to determine if they are adequate.  If the parcel plats are not adequate, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits the parcel plats.  If the parcel plats are adequate, the ROW Eng. transmits the parcel plats to appraisal.  If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant was not engaged, then the ROW Eng. Supervisor determines if staff is available to develop the parcel plats.  If staff is not available, the ROW Eng. Supervisor determines if a change in the schedule is acceptable.  If a change in the schedule is not acceptable, a contractor is procured.  If a change is acceptable then the ROW Eng. Supervisor makes the change and has the ROW Eng. draw up the parcel plats, which is what happens if the staff is available.  After drawing the parcel plats the ROW Eng. transmits the parcel plats to appraisal and acquisitions.  The ROW Eng. determines if there is appraisal driven parcelization changes.  If there are appraisal driven parcelization changes then the ROW Eng. Supervisor determines if the DPM needs to be consulted.  If the DPM is to be consulted the flow goes to where a determination is made on if an Ext. ROW Consultant are developing the plans.  If the DPM is not to be consulted, the ROW Eng. notified that revised project estimate is needed, also the ROW Eng. notifies pre-audit.  ROW Eng. makes a determination on if funding is sufficient.  If funding is not sufficient then the ROW Eng. Supervisor is notified that a revised project estimate is needed.  The project is in this state until funding is available.  Once funding is available the ROW Eng. reviews the ROW plans, parcel plats and transmits the revised parcel plats to appraisal.  If funding is sufficient then the ROW Eng. Supervisor makes a determination on if preliminary platting is approved.  If preliminary platting is not approved then the ROW Eng. Supervisor submits a request for preliminary platting approval and receives approval.  ?ALWAYS?  The ROW Eng. determines if there are platting plan driven parcelization changes.  If there are parcelization changes the same process happens as last time.  If there are no platting plan driven parcelization changes the ROW Eng. transmits the parcel plats to the negotiators.  If the ROW Eng. Supervisor determines that preliminary platting is approved the ROW Eng. transmits parcel plats to the negotiators.    The ROW Eng. determines if legal descriptions are required.  If a legal description is required then the ROW Eng. determines if an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant was engaged to do legal descriptions.  If an Ext. 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  89 FINAL – Revision 0   ROW Eng. Consultant was engaged then the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant submits draft legal descriptions to 
the ROW Eng.  The ROW Eng. determines if the draft legal descriptions are adequate.  If the legal descriptions are not adequate, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits to the ROW Eng.  If the legal descriptions are adequate then the ROW Eng. submits the legal descriptions to the negotiator.  If an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant was not engaged then the ROW Eng. writes the legal descriptions.  The Audit ROW Eng. determines if the legal descriptions are adequate.  If not the ROW Eng. revises and resubmits to the Audit ROW Eng.  If the legal descriptions are adequate then the ROW Eng. submits them to the negotiator.  Once the legal descriptions are submitted to the negotiator or it is determined that no legal descriptions are needed the ROW Eng. checks with the DPM for changes in the slope limit or centerline that affect the ROW.  If there are changes, the ROW Eng. determines if new parcels are affected.  If no new parcels are affected the ROW Eng. reviews, revises and resubmits to appraisals.    If new parcels are affected the ROW Eng. determines if a level three survey is required.  The ROW Eng. requests and receives a level three survey from survey.  If no level three survey is needed or a level three survey was received, the ROW Eng. assigns parcel numbers, orders new title report, computes new parcels, edits ROW plans, transmits ROW plan to other sections, draws parcel plats and transmits plats to appraisal.  If there are no changes then the Chief ROW Agent determines if there are condemnations.  If there are condemnations then the ROW Eng. prepares vicinity map, parcel plat, legal description, submits condemnation package to negotiators and provides support to the A.G. Office.    Once the condemnations are done or there were none needed the ROW Eng. checks with the DPM for changes in the slope limits or centerline that affect ROW parcels.  If there are changes, the loop for determining if there are new parcels is revisited.  If there are no changes, the ROW Eng. determines if a monument is required.  If a monument is required, the ROW Eng. writes a statement of services for the record of survey.  The ROW Eng. determines if a consultant is going to install/provide ROS.  If a consultant is going to be used the ROW Eng. determines if it is part if the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultants contract.  If it was not part of the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant contract, the ROW Eng. prepares an amendment to the contract for monument/record of survey.  Once the contract amendment is done or if it was part of the original contract, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant submits record if survey submittals.  ROW Eng. determines if the submittals are adequate.  If a revision to the submittals is required, the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant revises and resubmits the submittals.  Once the ROW Eng. determines no revises to the submittals are required, he/she records the record of survey.  If the ROW Eng. determines that a consultant is not going to install the monument/provide ROS the ROW Eng. determines if there is an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant for the ROW plans.  If there is an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant for the ROW plans then the ROW Eng. receives the Ext ROW Eng. Consultant’s final submittals and closes the Ext. ROW Eng. Consultants contract.  If there was no Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant, the ROW Eng. determines if the construction contractor will install the monument/provide the ROS.  If the construction contractor will install the monument or provide ROS, the ROW Eng. prepares scope of service and forwards it to the DPM.  If the construction contractor is not installing the monument or provide ROS the ROW Eng. forwards a statement of service to survey.  Once all of the monument processes are done, the ROW Eng. determines if the monument is adequate.  If it is not the process starts again with the ROW Eng. determining if an Ext. ROW Eng. Consultant will install or provide ROS.  If the ROW Eng. determines that no monument is needed or the monument is adequate, the ROW Eng. reviews design and ROW plans for certification.  The ROW Eng. checks for discrepancies 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  90 FINAL – Revision 0   between the ROW plans and the design plans.  If there are discrepancies, the ROW Eng. resolves and 
reviews again for certification.    If there are no discrepancies between the ROW plans and the design plans the ROW Eng. checks for possession with the A.G.  If no possession the ROW Eng. determines if there are discrepancies again.  If possession was accomplished the ROW Eng. Supervisor recommends to the ROW Chief certification of the project.  If the ROW Chief does not certify the project, it goes back to the ROW Eng. to review plans for certification.  If the ROW Chief certifies the project, the ROW Eng. Supervisor finalizes the ROW plans for construction.  The ROW Eng. Supervisor approves plans and transmits plans to the DPM.  The ROW Eng. determines if construction asked for additional information.  If construction asked for additional information, the ROW Eng. answers questions and/or requests title to complete additional title research.  Once the additional information the construction contractor asked for is done or it none was requested the ROW Eng. determines if there are changes due to certification.  If there were changes due to certification, the ROW Eng. updates the ROW plans.  Once the ROW plans are certified the ROW Eng. determines if there are any borough requirements related to platting.  If yes, the ROW Eng. satisfies the borough requirements.  Once the borough requirements are satisfied or if none were required, the ROW Eng. receives and reviews final judgment on condemnations.  The ROW Eng. determines if there are changes to the ROW plans due to judgment.  If there are changes to the ROW plans the ROW Eng. updates the ROW plans.  Once the ROW plans are updates or if no changes were needed the plans are recorded.

System Requirements Specification  100 FINAL – Revision 0   33.2.1. Notify Pre-audit of Awarded contract  
 
4.2.2 Pre-Audit/Finance Story 
 Pre-Audit (PA) receives notice of a request for estimate and PDA for phase 3 funding from the Design Project Manager (DPM).  After receiving notice PA receives completed Right of Way (ROW) Plans (RP) to initiate phase 3 ATP/Funding request.    After receiving the RP, PA does a cost estimate and submits the cost estimate to the DPM.  The cost estimate includes getting the number of parcels, man-hours, number of sheets for ROW Plans and number of parcel plats from engineering; getting the appraisals, man-hours and contract costs from appraisals; getting man-hours, demolition, removal and management from Property Management; and estimating man-hours through the close of the project.  PA then determines if the Chief ROW Agent DPM
/Project Agent approves the cost estimate.  If the CHIEF 
ROW AGENT/Project Agent does not approve the cost estimate, it is redone and resubmitted.  If the cost estimate is approved by the Chief ROW Agent DPM
/Project Agent PA monitors. Various? Databases to 
track the status of funding requests. ?Then PA updates status in comment project status section of the database?.  
 PA receives approved PDA & ATP from Project Control .  PA puts date into database along with getting 
PDA & ATP into project file.  PA Notifies functional groups of received ATP and funding.    After receiving funding, PA determines if there are obligations that require encumbrances.  If there are obligations that require encumbrances PA requests and receives approval Professional Services Contract, Stock Requests, Approved Appraisal Review Estimates
, Determinations/Value Estimates  anticipated 
obligations for legal fees and anticipated obligations for relocation fees.  After receiving the needed documents, PA determines if funding in AKSAS is sufficient.  If the funding in AKSAS is not sufficient, the flow goes to revising and resubmitting the cost estimate.  If the funding is sufficient, PA prepares and sends a memo to finance to encumber the funds.  Once finance encumbers funds or it was determined that no obligations required encumbrance
 PA receives notice that the 
fund are encumbered.  After receiving notice from finance that the funds were encumbered PA receives requests for payment.  After receiving a request for payment, PA determines if it is a Contract Payment, Acquisition Payment, Condemnation Payment, Relocation Payment or an invoice payment.  If it is a Contract Payment PA pulls the files, reviews the contract, makes any necessary coding corrections to the contract, confirms payment authorization and completes the database input form.  If it is an Acquisition Payment or a Condemnation Payment PA pulls all acquisition related files, completes parcel review form, completes database input form, completes transmittal checklist form, reviews transmitted documents and completes transmitted checklist.  If it is a Relocation Payment PA pulls acquisition and relocation files, completes relocation/parcel review form, completes relocation checklist form, determines relocation claim type, review transmitted documents and completes checklist.  If it is not a Contract, Acquisition, Condemnation or Relocation Payment then it is an invoice payment, in which case PA determines the type of invoice and/or financial obligation.    Next PA determines if the documentation is acceptable.  If the documentation is not acceptable, PA requests additional documents or corrections.  After receiving the additional documentation/corrections, it is reviewed.  Next it is determined if the additional documentation is adequate.  If it is not adequate, the request is remade.    
 
  
System Requirements Specification  101 FINAL – Revision 0   Once the documentation is adequate, PA determines if payment is eligible for federal participation.  If the 
payment is not eligible for federal participation PA codes the payment to non-participating funds.  If the payment is eligible for federal funds, the payment is coded for participating funds.  After the funding is coded, PA determines if funding is sufficient.  If the funding is not sufficient PA reviews current authorized estimates, reviews current expenditures on AKSAS, revises estimate to meet current/anticipated expenditures, inputs revised data into cost estimate through DPM
 Chief ROW 
Agent/ Project Agent to DPM and Project Control and receives additional funding. 
 After funding is sufficient, PA inputs data for tracking, reporting and queries.  After the data is input, PA prints and routes purchase voucher and agreement documentation to the Chief for signature.  If the Chief does not approve, the flow goes to requesting additional documentation/corrections.  If the chief approves PA determines if it is an acquisition or relocation payment.
  If it is not an acquisition 
or relocation  an invoice  payment PA sends approved invoice to finance for payment and the payment 
process is complete.  If it is an acquisition or relocation payment PA forwards invoice to finance and requests a return of warrant to PA.    Once PA receives the warrant from finance PA determines if it is an acquisition or relocation warrant.  If it 
is not an acquisition
 a relocation  warrant PA mails the warrant and signed claim documents to the payee 
with a return receipt requested.  Once the return receipt is received and filed the payment process is complete.  Note: Only Acquisition and Relocation payments are returned warrants to PA. All other payments (invoice) are made directly by DOA in Juneau to Payee (vendor).  
 If it is an acquisition payment the PA supervisor records documents, mails warrant and signed acquisition documents to payee with a return receipt requested.  Once the return receipt is received and filed PA notifies relocations and property management supervisors of date of property owner receipt of payment.  Once the relocation and property management supervisors are notified the payment process is complete.  
4.2.3 Pre-Audit Closure Story 
 Pre-Audit (PA) receives notification of certification from the Design Project Manage (DPM)
 ROW 
Chief/Engineering Supervisor PA adds the project to closeout list and identifies remaining Right of Way 
(ROW) Activities.  Once the project is added to the closeout list PA tracks remaining ROW activities.  PA determines if all ROW activity is complete.  If not all ROW activity is complete, PA continues to track the ROW activities.  If all ROW activities are complete PA reviews conveyance documents and plans then performs financial reconciliation.   This includes pulling ROW Plans (RP), pulling parcel files and core documents, confirming all ROW Unit Supervisors concur in closure of project, confirming LRH loans are paid in full and reconciles RP with conveyance documents.  Once the reconciliation
 review is done, PA determines if RP and conveyance documents (CD) reconcile.  If 
the RP and CD did not reconcile PA obtains required corrections and reconciles the RP and CD again.  Once the RP and CD reconcile PA reviews and totals account code costs (ACC) and compares totals with AKSAS.  PA determines if ACC and AKSAS reconcile.  If ACC and AKSAS does not reconcile PA researches using? Various? Records, the difference and requests necessary corrections.  
 
  
System Requirements Specification  102 FINAL – Revision 0   Once Account Code Costs (ACC) and AKSAS reconcile PA prepares a summary spreadsheet.  Once the 
summary spreadsheet is done, PA prepares and distributes closeout memo and signed Project Completion Form (PCF).

1. Introduction Meetings 
Sigvald J. Strandberg – Fairbanks Jeff Hill (Department of Transportation - Appraiser) – Operational Supervisor L. Bruce Bowler (SE – HQ Review Appraiser) 
2. Cycle of Action 
2.1. Discussion on "Where we are going?" 
2.2. Scheduling of the processes? 
3. Interesting Conversation – Acceptable reviews to fixing the problem. The regions are quite interested 
in moving this forward. 
4. Notes out of Flow Review:  
4.1. Specialty report will be incorporated into the fee or staff appraisal report. – Appraisals will not 
do the work on a specialty report – Internal staff of the contracting appraiser who will incorporate the report. Credit has to be given when the report is generated. 
4.1.1. Demolition Study 4.1.2. Parking Study 4.1.3. Get others from the group… 4.1.4. When you have a specialty report – will it be incorporated and is it part of the appraisal 
report? To what level can you integrate. 
4.2. If the contract does not have the right to generate an appraisal report, then it needs to be 
incorporated by staff into the appraisal reports. 
4.2.1. Appraisals involvement in developmental decisions… 
4.3. Adequacy – what does it mean? (Can we get the group to define this characteristics further or 
do we need to go to the DOT ROW Chiefs) 
4.3.1. Complies with assignment or the statement of services. 4.3.2. Adequacy is removed – too wishy washy….(cowardly lion) 
4.4. Parcel Design Changes cause tremendous delays

4.3.5 Appraisal Story 
 
The Appraisal Supervisor (AS) receives the Right of Way (ROW) Engineering Plans (Property Map) from 
the ROW Eng. Supervisor.  The AS requests updated Design Plans (DP) from the Design Project Manager (DPM).  The AS determines if the DP are sufficient to initiate Appraisal Plans (AP).  If the DP are not sufficient to initiate the AP the AS requests updated DP again. 
 
Once the DP are sufficient to initiate the AP the AS designates the Appraisal Staff.  The Appraisal Staff prepares the Appraisal plans, which includes an on-site inspection with ROW Plans in hand, gathering preliminary market data, determining with respect to individual acquisition parcels, whether to use value 
estimates or narrative appraisal reports, identifying the funding code and estimating the completion time frames.  Once the plans are complete, the AS determines if an AP update is needed.  If an AP update is needed the AP is revised.  Once the AP is sufficient the AS determines what parcels can be valued in a value estimate format.  If the parcels cannot be valued as a value estimate then the AS determines if the Appraisal Staff has the time and/or expertise needed to perform the appraisals. 
 If the Appraisal Staff does not have the time or expertise to perform the appraisals a Fee appraiser, secured 
under Professional Service Agreement (PSA). Once the PSA is received
 Before issuing a Notice to 
Proceed, the AS determines if any amendments are needed.  If an amendment is needed then a fee quote is 
requested and received from the contractor, an amendment to the PSA is drafted and the contractor signs the agreement. The ?ROW Agent?
 Contract Manager Prepares record of negotiations, the ROW Chief concurs 
and passes on the negotiations to the Professional Services Coordinator (PSC), the contracting officer signs the agreement, the AS determines if authority to appraise and acquire was received, once the authority to appraise and acquire is received the parcel information is requested and received from pre-plan, notification is sent to the contractor to proceed.  Once the amendment process is done or if no amendment was needed the contractor performs the work, produces the specialty or appraisal report.  If the contractor did a specialty report, a determination i
s made 
on if The specialty report is reviewed by the AS. part of an appraisal report that the staff is doing or is being 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  116 FINAL – Revision 0   done by another contract.  If the specialty report is part of a staff report, it goes to the Appraisal Staff.   The 
Appraisal Staff produces an Appraisal report or if the specialty report is not part of a staff report, it goes to the contractor fulfilling the contract for the appraisal report.  If the contractor did an appraisal report, it goes to the AS.  Once the AS receives the Appraisal Report the AS determines if the appraisal report is adequate.  If the appraisal report is not adequate, it goes back to the Contractor that prepared the appraisal report for revision and resubmission.  If the Appraisal Staff has the expertise to perform the work the AS determines if the current workload will allow the Appraisal Staff to perform the work.  If the workload is too great, the PSA loop is entered.  If the workload will permit the staff to do the work the AS assigns the appraisal to the staff.  The AS determines if special expertise
 a Specialty Report is needed.  If special expertise  Specialty Report  is needed then the PSA 
loop is entered.  If special expertise is not needed  Specialty Report and AS instructs staff to proceed with 
appraisal the AS determines if the authority to appraise and acquire was received. 
 Once the authority to appraise and acquire is received the AS requests and receives parcel information from pre-plan.  The appraisal staff performs appraisals according to USPAP and DOT&PF appraisal guidelines 
and write appraisal reports.  The AS determines if the appraisal report is adequate.  If the appraisal report is not adequate it goes back to the Appraisal Staff for revision and resubmission.  Once the appraisal report is adequate the AS prepares a memo for transmittal to Headquarters Appraisal Review (HQAR).  Once the memo is prepared the AS transmits the memo and appraisal report to HQAR.  HQAR performs a desk review, which includes reviewing the appraisal report, determining if the appraisal report meets state appraisal standards, determining if the contract items satisfy complete reporting per the contract, identifications of critical parcels, ensure report considers special legal or administrative concerns, determines if report meets uniform act standards, issues progress payment approval and determines if report meets eminent domain concerns.  HQAR performs a field review, which includes reviewing available reports for the same area outside of DOT, reviewing area and region value/economic trends, reviewing assessors database / appraisers data, reviewing DOT & PF approved data / value for consistency and spot check to verify data reported in appraisals.  The AS 
 HQ Appraiser (HQAR) then determines if corrections are needed on the appraisal 
report.  If corrections are needed on the appraisal report, HQAR are discussed with the appraiser.  The need for reconsideration or additional information is determined.  The HQAR provides the appraiser with additional data.  The HQAR receives the corrections from the appraiser.  The HQAR determines if the corrections are reasonable, appropriate and based on sound appraisal techniques.  If the corrections are not adequate, the loop starts again with a discussion with the appraiser.  If the corrections are adequate or if no corrections were needed a determination is made on if
 HQAR 
accepts the appraisal report and issues a determination of just compensation based on market value.  If 
HQAR does not accept the appraisal report then a determination is made if HQAR will make corrections or will write an independent evaluation.    If the HQAR will not make corrections / write independent evaluation then HQAR requests a second appraisal.  If a second appraisal is not needed the loop goes back to where the AS determines if an update of the AP is needed.  If a second appraisal is needed the loop goes back to where the AS determines if the Appraisal Staff has the expertise.  If HQAR accepts the appraisal report or will make corrections / write independent evaluation, HQAR produces independent report or corrects fee contract report.  Approval / Determination of just compensation 
is issued, which includes Review Appraiser’s (RA) approval of remaining contract payment
, establish 
uneconomic remnants, establish just compensation estimates , establish compensatory damages and special 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  117 FINAL – Revision 0   benefits, estimating allocation of value, and issuing a “Pink Sheet” change to an existing approved 
appraisal.  Once the HQAR portions are done, the AS notifies Pre-Audit of approval for final partial 
payment of the Appraisal Contract (normally 75%).  Regions Chief ROW Agent reviews HQAR’s determination of just compensation for approval for negotiations.  If the AS determines a parcel can be valued as a value estimate, the AS makes value estimate assignment to staff.  Appraisal staff determines if a value estimate is an appropriate method to determine parcel value.  If it is not an appropriate method the loop goes to where the AS determines if the staff has the expertise to perform appraisal.  If Appraisal Staff determines value estimate is a proper method for determining parcel value, the AS determines if authority to proceed with appraisal and acquisition was given.  Once authority for appraisal and acquisition is received the AS requests and receives parcel information from pre-plan.  The Appraisal Staff performs value estimate and sends the value estimate to the Regional ROW Chief.  The Regional ROW Chief determines if the value estimate or department just compensation is approved for negotiations.  If the value estimate or departmental just compensations is not approved the loop goes to where the AS determines if an update to the AP is needed.  If the value estimate or departmental just compensation is approved the AS transmits reports to negotiations, Acquisitions Section 
for negotiation assignment by Acquisition Supervisor and pre-audit for encumbering value estimate and/or 
Reviewer's Determinations . 
 A check is performed to determine if there are design changes.  If there was a design change a determination is made on if the design change can be dealt with a HQAR.  If the change can be dealt by HQAR the loop goes to where the HQAR begins with the desk review.  If the design change cannot be dealt by a HQAR the loop goes to where the AS determines if an update to the AP is needed.  If there was no design change the AS / Project Agent (?DPM?) determines if it is a FAA project.  If it is not an FAA project, negotiations start.  If it is a FAA project the Project Agent (?DPM?) submits the appraisal to FAA for review.  A determination is made on whether the FAA objects to appraisal.  If the FAA does not object, negotiations start.  If the FAA does object, the objections are resolved and negotiations start.

4.4.2 Acquisition Story 
 The Acquisition Supervisor (AS) / Projects Agent (PA) receives notice of phase three funding approval from Pre-Audit.  The AS reviews and updates staff assignments on projects.  The AS/PA determines if required data (plans and title) is present to continue with acquisitions.  If required data is missing it is retrieved from the Right of Way (ROW) Engineer or a decision is made to proceed with the current data. 
 
Once sufficient data is present, the AS/PA determines if a variance is required.  If a variance is required the AS completes and submits a variance application, attends any hearings on the variance and submits the results of any hearing to Appraisal.  Once the results of the variance is received or a variance was not needed the AS/PA determines if acquisitions activities can proceed.  If acquisition activities can not proceed the AS/PA resolves acquisitions issues, which may include completing native allotment certification, resolving federal title discrepancies, resolving tribal concerns, identify and enter ANCSA Section 14(c) entitlement, identify and enter utility needs, identify and enter access requirements, identify and enter material needs, and identify and enter land title interests to be appraised.  Once acquisitions can proceed the Acquisition Agent (AA) gets the Approved Fair Market Value or Value Estimate from Appraisal, which includes getting the legal description, parcel plats and title report from ROW Pre-Plan.  Then the AA gathers parcel data that includes R/W plans, plats and title reports are ordered/procured from R/W Engineering or appropriate consultant.  Appraisals are ordered or procured from the Appraisal section for each parcel of the project.  Design Study Report, Design Plans and TCP's are requested from Design.  AS/PA educate themselves to the project and each parcel.  In addition, a field review with Design, Appraisal, ROW Engineering Pre-Plan, a.k.a. Plan Preparation, Consultants and 
Relocations is conducted.  Once all of the data is gathered, the AA determines if updated title is needed.  If an updated title report is needed the AA orders an updated title report.  Once the updated title report is received or determination was made that an updated title report was not needed the ROW Chief (?AS/PA?) determines if retention will be offered.  If retention will be offered, the AA AS secures retention values for improvements. 
 Once the retention values are secured or a determination that retention will not be offered the AA/PA queries the Design Project Manager (DPM) for removal dates.  The AA prepares the acquisition package (AP), which includes the letter of offer, easements, warranty deeds, purchase voucher, memorandum of agreement, temporary construction permit, request for reconveyance, requests for deeds of partial or full 
reconveyance, preparation and entering election of payment forms, preparation and entering surface and subsurface easements, preparation and entering option contracts and rights of entry, preparation and 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  127 FINAL – Revision 0   entering bill of sale, preparation and entering non-development covenants, corporate or council resolutions, 
and Quit Claim Deeds (QCD).  Once the AP is done the AA makes First Offer contact with the owner, which includes locating the owner, initiating title clearing with the owner, and entering the contact into the record of negotiations
 contacts.   
Once First Contact is made the AA determines if any relocations are required.  If relocations are required the Relocation Agent  issues a 90
-day notice  benefit statement to the property owner and Acquisition Agent 
notifies Relocation and Property Management of Notice  of First Contact. 
 Once the 90-day notice is issued or if relocation is not needed the AA determines if the owner agreed to sign and return the Offer Documents (OD).  If the owner has not agreed to sign and return the OD the AA identifies the owners concerns.  Then the AA develops the Department’s response to the owner’s concerns and submits the response to the Acquisition Supervisor and ROW Chief.  The ROW Chief makes a 
determination on whether to approve the response to the owner’s concerns or not.  If the ROW Chief does not approve the response to the owners concerns, the response goes back to the AA for revision and resubmission.  Once the Acquisition Supervisor and  ROW Chief accepts the response to the owner’s concerns, the AA 
determines if the owner accepts the Department’s response to the owner’s concerns.  If the owner accepts the Department’s response to the owner’s concerns the AA revises the OD as needed and the flow goes to where the decision is made on if the owner has agreed to sign and return the OD.  If the Department’s response to the owner’s concerns is not accepted by the owner the AA determines if the owner has made a counter offer.  If the owner has made a counter offer the ROW Chief decides whether or 
not to  accept the counter offer or not
.  If the ROW Chief decides not to accept the counter offer or if the 
owner has not made a counter offer the AA sends the Final Letter to the owner and prepares recommendations for condemnation and submits the recommendations to the AS.  Once the AS receives the recommendations for condemnations the AS determines whether or not to recommend condemnation.  If the AS decides not to recommend condemnation the flow goes to where the AA sends the Final Letter to the owner and prepares recommendation for condemnation and submits the recommendation to the AS.  Once the AS decides to recommend condemnation the Pre-Construction Engineer (PCE) determines whether or not to approve condemnation.  If the PCE decides not to approve condemnation the Regional Director decides where to re-enter the Acquisition Flow.  If the PCE decides to approve the condemnation, the AA/PA requests decisional document from the DPM.  The AA completes section four of the decisional document.  Then the AA request schedules A, B and C and updated title reports from the ROW Engineer.  The AA transmits the condemnation file to Pre-Audit.  (ALWAYS?) Yes always now, but maybe not in new 
system - but $$ needs ordering for court deposit. The AA receives order of possession from the AG office. 
 If the ROW Chief decides to accept the owners counter offer the AA prepares recommendations for Administrative Settlement and submits to the Acquisition Supervisor and Row Chief.  The ROW Chief 
determines if the recommendation for Administrative Settlement is complete.  If the recommendation for Administrative Settlement is not complete, the AA revises and resubmits the recommendations for Administrative Settlement.  Once the recommendations for Administrative Settlements is accepted by the ROW Chief the ?AA?  determines if the Administrative Settlement is less than or equal to $10,000 over the current Reviewer's 
Determination.   If the Administrative Settlement is less than or equal to $10,000 the recommendation is 
sent to the ROW Chief ?Agent? for approval.  If the recommendation is greater than $10,000, the recommendation is sent to the ROW Chief, then to the PCE for approval. 
 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  128 FINAL – Revision 0   The AA determines if the Administrative Settlement is approved.  If the Administrative is approved the 
flow goes to where the AA revises the AD as needed.  If the Administrative Settlement was not approved, the AA determines of the Row Chief or PCE wants to continue negotiations.  If the ROW Chief or PCE does not want to continue negotiations the flow goes to where the AA sends the Final Letter and prepares recommendations for condemnation and submits to the AS.  If the ROW Chief or PCE wants to continue negotiations the flow goes to where the AA develops the Department’s response to the owner’s concerns and submits the response to the Acquisition Supervisor and ROW Chief. 
 If the owner has agreed to sign and return the OD the AA notifies Property Management and Relocations of possession.  After the AA notifies Property Management and Relocations of possession the AA completes the title risk clearing assessment.  Once the title risk clearing assessment is completed the ROW Chief determines if a title clearing is needed.  If a title clearing is needed the AA performs the title clearing, which includes obtaining needed signatures on any partial or full reconveyance, obtaining needed deed of partial or full reconveyance from the title company, obtaining needed consent to easement, obtaining needed release for liens and judgments, obtaining needed QCD, obtaining needed BIA clearance, obtaining needed release of lessee’s interests, and obtaining needed partial release of assessments.  Once the title clearing is complete or the ROW Chief determines that a title clearing was not needed, the AA determines if taxes need to be prorated.  If the taxes need to be prorated the AA prorates the taxes.  After the taxes are prorated or the ROW Chief determines that the taxes do not need to be prorated the AA transmits the AP and Title-Clearing Package to Pre-Audit.  Then the flow goes to where the AA determines if this is a FAA project. Following moved to end at suggestion of Northern Region:  Once the order of possession is received the AA determines if this is an FAA project or not.  If it is not an FAA project Acquisition is Complete.  If it is an FAA project the AA completes grant paperwork for the FAA, which includes preparing parts II pages on
e and two along with part I page tw o of the grant 
application and preparing sponsor certification.  Once the grant paperwork is prepared the AA prepares a draft title opinion and exhibit A, including updated property plan, and submits the grant package to the AG’s office.  Only sometimes - see attached changes to Plan Process Flow from PGS 
 After the grant package is sent to the AG the AA determines if the AG will sign the title opinion and submit it to FAA.  If the AG will not sign the title opinion or submit the package to the FAA the AA resolves the AG concerns and resubmits the grant package to the AG.  If the AG will sign and submit the grant package to the FAA the AA determines of the AG had exceptions to title opinion remanded.  If the AG had exceptions to the title opinion remanded the AA lists the exceptions in the grant application.  Once the AA completes outstanding property transactions and documents it in the comments section, the flow goes to where the AA prepares draft title opinion and exhibit A including updated property plan and resubmits to the AG’s office. If the AG did not have exception to the title opinion remanded then the AA prepares a hard copy file for 
submittal and discussion with construction.   Once Construction notifies the AA of completed construction, 
the AA determines if there are outstanding obligations to transfer Departmental properties.  If there are 
outstanding obligations the AA completes agreed to property exchanges and/or disposals.  Once the AA 
completes agrees to prope rty exchange and/or disposals or if there were no outstanding obligations to 
transfer Departmental properties Acquisition is Complete.  
Post construction - the Acquisition Agent completes any outstanding obligations.

4.5.2 Relocation Story 
 Once Relocations receives the Right of Way (ROW) Plans the Relocations Agent (RA) completes on-site inspection and prepares a Relocation Plan (RP) that includes a preliminary estimate.  The RA identifies properties with potential relocation.  Then the RA receives authority to appraise and acquire from Pre-Audit.    Once the authority to appraise and acquire is received the RA obtains copies of appraisals for relocations parcels from appraisals.  Once the RA has the appraisals the RA reviews the appraisals to identify what property is included in the Just Compensation.  The RA then creates the relocation files.  Next, the RA gathers property finance information and produces a resource information guide.  The RA then updates the inventory of comparable relocation properties.  The RA then receives notification of initiation of negotiations and occupant information.  After receiving the notification of negotiations the RA sets up an appointment with the person(s) to be relocated.  The RA performs initial review and completes occupancy report.  The RA determines if the occupant qualifies for benefits.  If the occupant does not qualify for benefits the RA notifies the occupant of their ineligible status , issues a 90 day notice to vacate  and verifies the occupants have moved.  Once the 
occupants are moved the property is turned over to property management.  If the occupant qualifies for benefits the RA determines occupancy status and applicable benefits.  After determining the occupancy and benefits the RA prepares a benefits statement with a list of comparables.  The RA then submits benefit statement to the ROW Chief for approval of the benefits.  If the ROW Chief 
does not approve the benefits statement the RA revises and resubmits.  After the ROW Chief approves the benefits statement the RA makes offer of benefits, issues a 90-day notice and notification of appeals process.  After making the offer and issuing the notifications the RA assists the person(s) to be relocated in obtaining financing.  RA performs DS&S inspection on the replacement home 
 
  
System Requirements Specification  138 FINAL – Revision 0   and notifies relocation on finding. Once the RA receives notification of possession from the negotiator the 
RA issues a 30-day notice to vacate.  Once the DS&S inspection is done the RA determined if the new housing passed the DS&S inspection.  If the new housing did not pass the DS&S inspection the RA notifies the occupants that the property did not pass the DS&S inspection.  The RA then determines if the occupant asked for a re-inspection.  If a re-inspection was asked for the DS&S is redone and the flow goes to where the RA determines if the new housing passes the DS&S inspection. Once the inspection is done the RA notifies the person(s) of the DS&S 
of the findings by form.  
 Once the 30-day notice to vacate is issued the RA determines if the occupant has moved.  If the occupant has not moved the property is turned over to property management.  Once the occupants have moved the RA conducts a final DS&S inspection and occupancy on replacement housing and fills out the appropriate 
form.    If a re-inspection was not requested the RA determines if the timeframe is within the allowable timeframe.  If the timeframe is within the allowable timeframe the flow goes to where the RA determines the new housing passes DS&S.  If the timeframe is not within the allowable timeframe the RA determines if an extension has been given.  If and extension has been given the flow goes to where the RA determines if the new housing passes the DS&S inspection.  If an extension was not given the RA submits claim to pay for the moving costs only and turns the property over to property management.  Once the RA receives the closing documents and prepares the claim forms, the RA performs the final inspection to verify the person(s) to be relocated have moved out and occupied the replacement property.  After the final inspection the RA submits a claim form to Pre-Audit for final payment and turns the property over to Property Management. Note:  
• Benefit statement includes Last Resort housing 
• Last Resort housing can also be incurred during the loan for replacement housing process. While the 
actual steps are the same we need a place … steps within the program or computer because of reporting to FHWA. 
• Affects last six paragraphs above.

according to group. 
3.1.2.4. Reality – Acquisitions problems and interactions will not go away… (personal reality 
groupings) 
4. Relocation Plan must be approved prior to continuing with the Property Management Plan. 5. Can we change the Section (Appraisal etc.)? Agent to the ROW Agent (since they all potentially 
capable of doing the same jobs)…?

7. Once it goes to Pre-Audit – Property Management – Finance sent the letter out when the adjustments 
went out. ??? 
8. What about excess properties (identified by engineering and acquisitions) Acquisitions may use excess 
property as a negotiating tool. When all negotiations are done and everything is handed over to Property Management, we do not sell any excess property until the project is complete. Excess land then goes into the "non" project related property management functions.  
8.1. Appraisal term: Buy a strip of property – below minimum standards – not large enough – buy 
the entire property
