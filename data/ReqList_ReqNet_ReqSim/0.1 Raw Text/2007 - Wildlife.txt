SRS v1.1.doc - 3 - Printed on: 5/11/2007 10:03:00 AM 2.3. User Classes and Characteristics 
User Class Characteristics 
GIS novices (favored) This category of users is the most prominent in the Regions 
based on the interview results.  The HCP Activities Management 
Application will need to consider the limited GIS training and 
experience of these users.   
GIS professionals Although the application will be mainly designed for the GIS 
novices, it will also need to allo w the GIS professi onals in these 
Regions to utilize their knowledge and GIS skills without being 
constrained by the HCP Activities  Application functionalities. 
 
SRS v1.1.doc - 4 - Printed on: 5/11/2007 10:03:00 AM 2.4. Operating Environment 
OE-1 The software application developed shall reside on the DFW desktop computers of the 
application’s primary users. 
OE-2 The system input data shall reside in the DFW SQL (SQL Server) database environment 
and in a detached user (ACCESS) database environment. 
OE-3 The system shall operate within and be compatible with the DFW network environment. 
OE-4 The system shall be compatible with th e current DFW minimum desktop configuration 
hardware and software standards, as defined below: 
Environment Standards 
Desktop Operating System: Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 or XP 
Directory Services: LDAP 
GIS: ArcGIS 9.2 
GIS License: ArcView or Better ArcGIS Editor 
Disconnected Database Types: Personal (MS Access) 
Email: Groupwise (Outlook soon) 
Office Applications: Microsoft Office (2000) 
ArcSDE: ArcSDE 9.1 (ArcSDE 9.2 soon) 
SQL Server Version 2000 (Migrating to 2005 soon) 
2.5. Design and Implementation Constraints 
CO-1 The system shall be developed in ArcGIS 9.2 and available as an extension on the DFW 
network. 
CO-2 The system shall be developed using VB.NET for .NET 2.0 framework with Windows user 
interfaces. 
 
CO- 3    Application development will adhere to  the model-view-controller architectural pattern. 
This pattern serves to separate data (model) and user interface (view) concerns, so that 
changes to the user interface do not affect  the data handling, and that the data can be 
reorganized without changing the user interf ace. Adhereing to the model-view-controller 
pattern will decouple data access and busine ss logic from data presentation and user 
interaction, by introducing an intermediate component: the controller. 
 
CO- 4   Variables will be created using camel case (creating compound words or phrases in which 
the words are joined without spaces and are capitalized within the compound with the first 
letter of the variable lowercase).  
 CO- 5   Variables referencing ArcObjects com classes, interfaces, or objects will not be 
abbreviated and will be dimensioned using a ca mel case naming convention. Do not use 
pointers such as m_p or g_p as a prefix to ArcObjects classes/interfaces. 
  
CO- 6    Do not use prefixes to variables such as int, str, lng, etc. 
 
CO-7    In-line documentation for coding, flow chart and/or diagram – what each module does, 
who did it and when it was done 
 
 
SRS v1.1.doc - 5 - Printed on: 5/11/2007 10:03:00 AM CO-8    Methods, procedures and functions will be sufficiently commented to support 
maintenance programmers with easily under standing the logic and purpose of the 
routines. 
CO- 9    Once delivered, code will to be managed through WDFW’s CVS repository 
2.6. User Documentation and Technical Support 
UD-1  The user documentation (Help and Tutorial ) shall be available as a separate electronic 
document (PDF) which can be opened from within the system. 
UD- 2    The user documentation will use screen captures of application interfaces to illustrate 
methods and procedures. 
2.7. Assumptions and Dependencies 
AD-1 The Department of Fish and Wildlife shall provide leadership and support to successfully 
implement the HCP Activities Management Tool in the department. 
AD-2 The users of the HCP Activities Managem ent Tool shall have basic knowledge/training of 
ArcGIS and its editing functions (spatial and tabular edits). 
AD-3 Administrative tools for managing lookup tables will be provided (Based on budget 
approval). 
AD-4 The initial application will allow users to only archive (not delete) records.   
AD-5 The application will be developed to accommodate 3 Event types (O&M, Recreation, and 
E&R) for 3 feature types resulting in 9 Activity feature classes. 
2.8. Transaction Environment 
TE-1 The application will directly work with SQL server for tabular data transactions. 
TE-2 The application will directly work with ArcSDE for Spatial Data transactions. 
TE-3 The application will work in any ArcSDE versioning environment.  Users will be required 
to use the appropriate SDE connection to be within the database’s configured 
transactional environment.

SRS v1.1.doc - 19 - Printed on: 5/11/2007 10:03:00 AM Appendix C:  Activities Data Model Description 
Description of the WDFW Activities Data Model  
 
Many different types of activities occur on WD FW owned and managed lands. These activities can be 
classified as one of three broad types of acti vities: recreation, operation and maintenance, or 
enhancement and restoration. Each of the activities can be more specif ically described as participating 
in a class of activities and a subclass of activities.  Class and Subclass provide for a more detailed set of 
distinguishing characteristics. 
 
Activities may optionally be identified as being subj ect to regulations or polices. This could include 
Washington Administrative Codes (WACs), Revis ed Code of Washington (RCW), WDFW Rules and 
Regulations, local government ordinances, and Federal Laws. 
 Activities can occur on either a regular or periodic basis, within a calendar year or across many years. 
The duration of an activity can be described by the num ber of days that each event of an activity occurs.  
The frequency of activity can be described by it annual reoccurrence. Activities can both occur 
individually or be associated with one or more other activities.  
 
Information about activities will be collected from a variety of sources and will be based on a variety of 
data collection methods and procedures. Each may have higher or lower confidence associated with 
them.  
 
Each confidence source may have some combinatio n of the name of the source, document name, web 
reference, date, contact information and a source confidence designation of: • A Legal Description 
• Empirical Data 
• Expert Opinion • Best Professional Judgement 
• Modeled Data 
 Each activity will be designated as occurring wi thin a described WDFW administrative area. The 
designations will be hierarchical, going from Region to  Complex; Complex to Wildlife Area; and Wildlife 
Area to Wildlife Area Unit. Some activity areas may not be currently assigned to the hierarchy and 
designated as being unassigned. 
 
Each activity can be measured in terms of the intens ity of effort that is applied. These metrics will be 
expressed in terms of the quantity, units, and measur e. For instance 100 (quantity) pounds (unit) per 
acre (measure) or 10 (quantity) people (unit) per campsi te (measure).  An activity can have zero or more 
measured efforts. Metrics will only be collected at the Ac tivity level. Individual occurrences of an activity 
will inherit the metrics of the parent activity. If it is important to apply a different level of effort, then a new 
activity will need to be created in order to capture a variance in the metrics. The system should support 
propagating existing core activity attributes into a ne w activity in order to minimize the need for new data 
entry when the only significant change is effort. A highly desired functional property of the application 
would be to allow the user to place checkboxes next to those fields that should be propagated into the 
new record. 
 
Activities often are associated with other activities. Many activities can be associated with one activity 
and the one activity can be associated with one or more other activities. This results in a many-to-many 
relationship between activities. The system will need to support several workflows around the process of 
associating activities. This includes • Creating activity records prior to creating spatial data 
• Linking existing spatial data to an activity 
 
SRS v1.1.doc - 20 - Printed on: 5/11/2007 10:03:00 AM • Un-linking spatial data to an activity 
• Associating an activity to other activities 
• Unassociating an activity from an activity   
Each activity will be managed as both tabular data an d spatial data. One requirement is that the system 
support creating tabular records for activities independ ent of the process of crea ting the spatial data that 
must be linked to the activities.  This will allow fo r creating a placeholder for more specific information 
that will be collected during visits for satellite offices. 
 In order to reduce application development cost, a strategy has been identified for managing records 
that are no longer needed due to a change in informati on, methods, or mistakes. This application deals 
with both tabular and spatial data that is linked th rough an application assigned primary key, which is 
carried in both the tabular and spatial records. It w ould be costly to develop an application that manages 
deletions of both the tabular and spatial data. Not to  mention that features could be deleted outside the 
application. Each record in the Activity, Activity Association, and Activity Occurrence tables will be 
attributed as being in some stage of archival state (e .g. Not Archived, Archived with Delete, Archived, 
etc). This level of attribution will support a bette r understanding on the reason for making a record 
inactive. 
 
 At beginning of a session (when application is first init iated) user will be prompted to set default options 
for confidence and methods sources. 
 Inventory sessions will occur in the field and be di sconnected from the SQL database. The application 
and the tabular and spatial records will be “checked out”  to the inventory biologist and used on a laptop.  
While data is “checked out” that  particular data on the SQL database will  be editable.  When data is 
“checked in” the application will need to: 1) reconcile and update the SQL database with new additions 
to look up tables that may have occurred when disconnected, and 2) reconcile and update any new 
and/or modified activities records.
