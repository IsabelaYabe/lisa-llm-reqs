1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background  
For an initial period of 2007 -2011 , data access management was funded through a 
data access grant between the EC and ESA.  
As from October  2010 the next step of the EC -ESA cooperation, the Delegation 
Agreement  [RD1], ensure d continuity of the data provision . That new phase was 
intend ed to widen the scope of the data access to a broader community.  It introduced 
the concept of a Data Warehouse , capturing the require ments of the  different  user 
communit ies. The Data Warehouse  is based on two types of data: (i) a fixed part , 
called 'CORE datasets' , which are typically well defined large datasets covering the 
needs of FP7 project  participant s and other users and (ii) a f lexible part called 
'ADDITIONAL' datasets. This approach has proven to be  flexible enough to 
accommodate further additional requirements or specific requirements which were  
not covered by the CORE datasets and not known in advance.  
This Data Warehouse v2.0 document build s on the previous experience and contains  
the new Copernicus data requirements for the period 2014 -2020 during which time a 
fully operational Copernicus programme  will be established . This document also 
addresses access to observation datase ts already provided under the previous phases.  
1.2. Scope and objective  
This document presents the Copernicus requirements  for space -based Earth 
Observation data  for the period covered by the Copernicus Regulation . It contains 
the requirements collected from Co pernicus services and other users  requesting 
Earth Observation data , whether financed by the Union or related to policies of the  
Union, like Union -financed research projects and the activities of Union agencies 
(EEA, EMSA, SatCen (previously EUSC), etc .). 
This document has a strong focus on the requirements for Contributing Mission data 
to be procured, it being understood that priority should be given to the use of 
dedicated Copernicus ( Sentinel ) data wherever  feasible. Thus,  it may progressively 
evolve tow ards the consolidation of all satellite data requirements for Copernicus 
services independently of whether licences for the data need to be procured or not. It 
should also be noted that s ome users are exclusively interested in E arth Observation  
data openly  disseminated to ensure that any interested parties questioning the results 
of their analysis may put them to the test using the same E arth Observation  data as 
inputs.  
Where datasets need to be procured, licensing conditions are negotiated with 
contributin g mission data providers and will depart from conditions of use of 
datasets available under an open data policy. The procurement of datasets requires 
the establishment of a contractual framework between the Copernicus Contributing 
Mission (CCM) Entities, E SA and the users , which should not be confused with the 
Copernicus Data and Information Policy  which enshrines free, full and open access . 
5 Technical specifications should be extracted from the requirements expressed in this 
document to ensure the provision  or procurement of Earth Observation data  from 
Copernicus Contributing Missions . ESA play s a key role in the provision of these 
Earth Observation data from Copernicus Contributing Missions as captured in the 
Delegation Agreement between the Commission and ESA [RD 4]. EUMETSAT  also 
plays an important  role in providing Contributing Mission data in accordance with 
the Delegation Agreement between the Commission and EUMETSAT  [RD5]. 
The approach suggested in this document aims at deepening , as much as possible , 
users' right s along th e following  major principles:  
(1) A strong emphasis on providing the necessary datasets to ensure the optimal 
functioning of the Copernicus services while mutualising as much as 
possible the needs of different user communities, mainly inst itutional and 
related to the Space t heme of Horizon 2020 research programme ; 
(2) The licensed rights must ensure the fulfilment of the Copernicus services' 
operational tasks , the goal is to avoid any restrictions on the dissemination of 
the information extract ed from the CCM data by the Copernicus services;  
(3) Predefinition of CORE  datasets  when the specifications can be provided in 
advance with sufficient detail ; 
(4) Bulk  agreement for ADDITIONAL  datasets  with flexible specifications, e.g. 
geographical area, under th e establishment of predefined quotas ; 
(5) Access to datasets procured in the previous phases of the provision of 
Contributing Mission datasets.  
The CORE Datasets are define d in this document . By definition , the ADDITIONAL  
datasets are flexible and are not know n in advance, therefore technical details cannot 
be provided at this stage, but only general requirements and principles on the quota 
management mechanism.  
As some ADDITIONAL dataset requirements are more precisely defined than 
other s, it is interesting to  provide the available information  on these requirements 
while , for the time being , leaving them in the ADDITIONAL datasets category.  
The approach for the procurement of the two types of da tasets  will consequently 
also be different: CORE  datasets can be pr ocured on the basis of pre -defined 
specifications, ADDITIONAL  datasets through a quota  mechanism and bulk 
agreements with data providers for the provision of data within a financial envelop e.

7 2.  GENERAL DEFIN ITIONS  
(1) Primary Dataset : Any spatial dataset  originating from a Copernicus  Contributing 
Mission Entity (CCM E) and provided by ESA /EUMETSAT /CCM E to the 
beneficiary . A Primary Data  set is understo od to include  spacecraft and instrument  
data and is comprised of single -mission Level 1 or Level 2 data (with  exceptional 
provision of higher -level products such as single -mission Level 3 data on a case-
by-case basis).  
(2) Altered Prima ry Dataset : A dataset de rived from a Primary Dataset retaining 
enough information to allow the re trieval  of the Primary Dataset (e.g. sensor pixel 
information) and therefore to allow the replication of the Primary Dataset as such. 
Examples: histogram stretched images, ortho -rectified images, resampled and 
rescaled images  and mosaics.  
(3) Derived Information , Derived Product  or Secondary Dataset : A Dataset or 
information derived from a Primary Dataset or Altered Primary Dataset which 
does not allow the re trieval  of the Primary Dataset (e.g. sensor pixel information) 
and therefore do es not allow the replication of the Primary Dataset as such. 
Examples: land cover classifications, vegetation indexes.  
(4) Metadata:  Information describing spatial data sets and spatial data services and 
making i t possible to discover  them , populate an inventory  with them  and use 
them. In the case of spatial dataset s, metadata may include a preview of the full 
dataset.  
(5) Union Public tasks : The development, implementation and monitoring of 
policies and related activ ities as defined by the EC Treaty and subsequent 
Community legislation.  
(6) Spatial Data sets, Spatial D ata and Spatial Data Services : As defined in 
Directive 2007/2/EC of 14/3/2007 . 
(7) Composite:  Multi-scene or multi -image aggregation over the same scene/image. 
Usually used to remove clouds for optical sensor  datasets . Can be applied to 
different sensors, but is preferably based on the same sensor. A composite is 
multi -temporal (made of several scenes/images acquired at different dates /times ). 
(8) Mosaic:  Multi-scene or multi -image aggregation to cover a larger area than a 
given scene/image. Can be applied to different sensors. A mosaic is generally 
mono temporal (or made of scenes/images collected within a given time period 
that can range from a few days to a season).  
(9) Bundled Data P roduct:  Refers to a commercial offer providing all datasets 
acquired simultaneously by the same satellite mission and simultaneously 
covering more than one range of spectral resolutions (e.g. multispectral and 
panchromatic), which are groupe d into a single product, but which are still 
comprise d of each of the separate spectral bands.  
8 (10) Ground sampling distance (GSD) : Specifies the extent of a single pixel of the 
sensor(s) that makes the dataset. Pixels are assumed to be square. Unless 
otherwise  specified  the values are:  
(a) VHR1 : <= 1m  
(b) VHR2 : >1m – <=4m  
(c) HR1 : >4m – <=10m  
(d) HR2 : >10m – <=30m 
(e) MR1:  >30m – <=100m 
(f) MR2:  >100m  – <=300m  
(g) LR: >300m  
 
9 3. NOTIONS AND CONVENTIO NS 
Many requirements contained in this Data Warehouse document will be used to 
draft  the technical specifications for the public procurement of EO remote sensing 
datasets. In this context a number of notions and conventions must be provided  and 
are part of  the requirements . 
3.1. User categories  and use purposes  
User types are defined below. The sectio ns below also define the usage allowed by 
each user category. User categories are referred to in the specifications by their 
abbreviation in square brackets. These user categories  shall only be applied  for 
datasets provided under restrictive dissemination conditions by the CCME . 
Wherever contributing mission data providers mak e available  datasets under an 
open data policy, the user indications under licensing requirements are meaningless 
most of the time  as all users including the general public may have ac cess to the data 
from the contributing mission data providers.  
3.1.1.  Copernicus Services [Copernicus Services]  
Copernicus Services first established under the EU Regulation 911/2010 and 
then under the subsequent EU Regulation establishing the Copernicus 
programm e.  
This category is provided for clarification. Legally speaking, Copernicus 
Services providers are either Institutions and bodies of the Union (see below) 
or their sub -contractors and therefore do not need an extension of licensing 
rights beyond these pr ovided to the [Union _Inst] , in particular for already 
acquired licensing right s on datasets  from previous Data Warehouse 
exercise s. 
3.1.2.  Institutions and bodies of the Union  [Union _Inst]  
The institutions and bodies of the Union,  as well as their contractors , may 
use the Primary Datasets  and Altered Primary Datasets for activities whose 
purpose is within the Union  Public tasks (development, implementation and 
monitoring of policies and related activities as defined by the Union  Treat ies 
and subsequent Union  legal  acts). 
It includes:  
(1) The European Institutions set up under the Union  Treaties ; 
(2) The European Union Agencies.  
3.1.3.  Participants to a research project financed under the Union research 
programmes  [Union_Research_Projects ] 
This includes a ny natural or legal person  officially registered as participant 
of a project funded under the FP 7 or H orizon 2020 Space themes.  
Participants in such projects  may use the Primary Datasets for activities 
within the project.  
10 As an option, p articipants to a project financed under Horizon 2020 outside 
the Space themes may use for activities within the project , already  acquired  
Primary Datasets . 
3.1.4.  Public authority [Public_Auth]  
Public authorities include:  
(1) Any government or other public administration  of States participating 
in the Copernicu s programme , including public advisory bodies, at 
national, regional or local level .; 
(2) Any natural or legal person performing public administrative 
functions under national law, including specific duties, activities or 
services in relation to a Union  policy ; 
(3) Any natural or legal person having public responsibilities or 
functions, or providing public services relating to a Union  policy 
under the control of a body or person fall ing within (1) or (2), such as 
a contractor of a public authority;  
(4) Any research and academic organisation.  
Public authorities , as well as their contractors , may use the Primary Datasets  
and Altered Primary Datasets for activities whose purpose is within the 
Union  Public tasks.  
3.1.5.  International  Organisations  and international NGOs 
[INT_ORG_NGO ] 
Interna tional  Organisations  are defined as:  Any International Governmental 
Organisation created by an international treaty which can be looked up in the 
UN online  database of treaties. Specialis ed agencies of the UN are included;  
International Organisations , as well as their contractors , may use the Primary 
Datasets  for activities whose purpose is within the Union  Public tasks . 
The international NGOs are defined as:  Any International Non -
Governme ntal Organisation speciali sed in humanitarian , development or 
environmental activities.  
Non-Governmental Organisation s, as well as their contractors , may use the 
Primary Datasets  for activities whose purpose is within the Union  Public 
tasks . 
3.1.6.  Public [Public ] 
Any natural or legal person.  
In the case that the Download service (see below) is authorised for  the 
Public, the use of the Primary Datasets  may be limited to non-commercial 
activities.  
11 3.2. Usage types (services)  
The usage types have been defined adhering to  the INSPIRE nomenclature ( Article 
11(1) (a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2007/2/EC) . For each dataset the usage type per 
user category should be specified . 
 
3.2.1.  DISCOVERY  Service  
The DISCOVERY service shall make it possible to  search for spatial 
datasets and ser vices on the basis of the content of the corresponding 
metadata and to display the content of the metadata.  
All users can access such service s. 
3.2.2.  VIEW Service  
The VIEW service shall make it possible, as a minimum, to display, 
navigate, zoom in/out, pan or ov erlay viewable spatial datasets and to display  
legend information and any relevant content of metadata.  
3.2.3.  DOWNLOAD Service  
The DOWNLOAD service shall enable the beneficiary:  
(1) to make an unlimited number of copies of the Primary Dataset  as 
needed (archiving an d backup purposes included);  
(2) to install on as many individual computers as needed, including 
internal computer network;  
(3) to alter or modify the Primary Dataset  by invoking a computer 
application to produce Altered Primary Dataset  and Secondary 
Dataset ; 
(4) to post Metadata of the Primary Dataset  or its Altered Primary 
Dataset  on an Internet website with the display of a credit in the 
following form : “includes material (c) Mission name (year of 
acquisition), all rights reserved”;  
(5) to make hard  copies or to display  on an Internet web site a 
Representation of any extract of the Primary Dataset  or its Altered 
Primary Dataset  at any resolution, with the display of a credit in the 
following form : “includes material (c) Mission name (year of 
acquisition), all rights rese rved”;  the data received  by client 
applications , through the above Internet posting, should be such that 
it is not possible to recreate  the Primary Dataset or Altered Primary 
Dataset  (unless that right is provided) ; 
(6) to use the Primary Dataset  or its Altere d Primary Dataset  for internal 
or external demonstration purposes;  
(7) to retain all Intellectual Property Rights associated with any 
Secondary Dataset developed on the basis of the Primary Dataset . 
12 3.3. Usage rights  
(a) The licensed usage rights must ensure the fulfil ment of the 
Copernicus services' operational tasks  as defined under the 
Copernicus Regulation . In particular the licensed rights shall not 
prevent  the generation and dissemination of Copernicus service 
information  (derived information from CCM primary datasets used as 
inputs) under a free, full  and open dissemination regime in 
application of the Commission Delegated Regulation No 1159/2013  
and the Copernicus Regulation . 
(b) In the case of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service and 
the Copernicus Security S ervice, [Public_Auth]  shall have access to 
Primary Datasets.  
(c) When the  CCME provides download access to CCM data with the 
authorisation to set up a viewing service  for these data , the 
[Union _Inst]  will have the righ t to set up such viewing service . 
3.4. Access t o datasets for public tasks and research projects  
The operational nature of Copernicus implies operational access conditions 
to contributing missions. However, some Copernicus users may not need 
access to remote sensing data in operational mode and therefo re should also 
enquire about other access schemes to these data.  
– Researchers may benefit from access schemes to EO data designed for 
their needs ; 
– Public authorities also benefit from specific access schemes for data 
needs in the accomplishment of their pub lic tasks.  
13 4. GENERAL OVERVIEW OF T HE REQUIREMENT S 
4.1. CORE  datasets  
The CORE datasets aim at consolidating predefined needs collected from 
Copernicus services and other activities requesting Earth Observation data 
whether financed by the Union or related to pol icies of the  Union , like Union 
financed research projects and the activities of Union agencies (EEA, 
EMSA, SatCen , etc.). This approach allows a more robust and cost -effective 
access mechanism, which will be offered to a broad range of users and 
activities . In particular : 
(1) For the f ulfilment of the data needs for the Copernicus Land  
Monitoring service , it should cover:  
(a) Pan-European (EEA39)  High Resolution (HR)  cloud free 
image coverage for the requirements of land cover/ land cover 
change activities (Corine : CLC and CLCC ), and 5 High 
Resolution Layers (HRLs) on land cover characteristics  
(imperviousness, forestry, agriculture (grasslands), permanent 
wetlands and small water -bodies . It shall include access to 
archives . 
(b) Full European Very High Resolution ( VHR ) coverage over 
Europe (EEA39) matching the requirements of applications at 
European  level (Urban Atlas,  Land cover on riparian zones for  
the purpose of biodiversity monitoring,  monitoring of coastal 
areas, risk areas, protected areas ( Natura 2000 sites ), Lan d 
Parcel Identification  and at national level.  
(c) For Dynamic Land monitoring: daily L ow Resolution (LR)  
and M edium Resolution (MR)  full globe coverage for the 
production of biogeophysical parameters in the global 
component of Copernicus Land Monitoring servi ce. 
(d) For seasonal vegetation monitoring: monthly to 15-day cloud 
free composites of Medium Resolution (MR) full European 
(EEA39) coverage during the vegetation period March -
October . 
(2) For the f ulfilment of the data needs of the Copernicus M arine  
Environment Monitoring , Atmosphere Monitoring and Climate 
Change services . 
4.2. ADDITIONAL  datasets with predefined quotas  
ADDITIONAL  datasets are needed to complement the CORE datasets , as 
many  data characteristics are not know n in advance (e.g. satellite tasking for 
rapid  mapping or security applications , selected areas for biodiversity 
monitoring ). 
14 As for the CORE  datasets, these ADDITIONAL  datasets are expected to 
fulfil the needs collected from Copernicus services and other activities 
requesting Earth Observation data , whether financed by the Union or related 
to policies of the  Union, like Union financed research projects and the 
activities of Union agencies (EEA, EMSA, SatCen, etc .). 
Some assumptions have been made for the specification of requirements:  
 The envelop e estimates should be made on the basis of a 
combination of statistics and requirements from operational 
Copernicus services, current European research  projects, previous 
projects and other related activities ; 
 The needs of Copernicus  services in support to cris is management 
are consi dered with the highest priority;  
 ADDITIONAL datasets covering 'non-crisis' activities (e.g. specific 
requirements for Copernicus Land Monitoring service not covered 
by the CORE datasets ) will be provided with medium priority ; 
 In addi tion some specific requirements from EU Institutions and 
agencies ( e.g. EMSA, SatCen ) can be satisfied through the provision 
of ADDITIONAL datasets ; 
 Horizon 2020  project  needs may be covered by ADDITIONAL 
datasets . 
4.3. Access to Contributing Mission data provi ded under previous phases  
Access to CORE datasets and ADDITIONAL datasets from previous 
acquisition campaign s should  be ensured  wherever feasible . Where the 
licensing conditions made for the use of these  datasets were  limited in time, 
the extension of the licence shall be made when the datasets are used in 
recurring monitoring activities  and reference. As a principle t he licenc e shall 
not limit in time the use of the data sets by Copernicus . 
4.4. Licensing conditions  
The overall principle should be to have a broa d access to CORE  datasets, 
whereas access to ADDITIONAL  data managed through quotas could be 
more limited.  
Regarding the pan-Europe and Europe  CORE  datasets  (wall -to-wall HR pan-
Europe  coverage, VHR Europe  coverage, monthly 15 -day HR composites) 
and the Gl obal MR and LR coverage , the licence s should include 
unrestricted access to the Primary Data set for the Copernicus Services,  
Union Institutions, Public Authorities and Union financed research  projects. 
This should be the case also for the archive d full sub -Saharan  HR coverage , 
which  also include s access for International organisations and NGOs

5. DATASET  REQUIREMENTS  
This section provides the definition of required datasets. The objective of this 
section is to present  the Copernicus requirements , identifying  the criteria , which 
will have a s ignificant impact on the co st of data . This should give sufficient 
details to derive technical specification s as input for the data/licence procurement . 
5.1. Overall dataset requirements  
REQ -5.1.1 -1 Use of Sentinel data  
Whe rever Sentinel data can be used to fulfil the requ irements  expressed in 
this document , they should be considered with priority.  In view of 
budgetary limitations, some requiremen ts may need a progressive phase -in 
with the availability of Sentinel data fulfilling these needs.  
REQ -5.1.1 -2 Data archiv ing and a ccess  to ar chives  
When the licences on satellite datasets need to be procured, the datasets 
must remain accessible as archives for future use by users benefiting from 
the rights attached to the DWH licence . 
5.2. Overall requirements  for CORE datasets  
REQ -5.2.1 -1 Sensor transitions  
The provision of datasets shall support a seamless transition when satellite 
missions supporting the data provision are replaced by new ones, as far as 
technically possible. The data provision scheme shall thus support the 
parallel provision of data from the  old and the new missions for the 
duration necessary to allow cross calibration and comparability of datasets 
(as far as the implication on the budget distribution is reasonable).  
REQ -5.2.1 -2 Consistency  
During each acquisition campaign the dataset characteristics of procured 
data shall not be modified unilaterally by the data providers.  
REQ -5.2.1 -3 Formats, INSPIRE metadata  and File naming  
CCME data shall be delivered in standard formats; with complete and 
validated INSPIRE compliant  metadata . The datasets shall be identified 
according to a standard file naming convention.  
A single, common harmonised format should be considered for the 
delivery of individual files used to provide wall -to-wall coverage of an 
AOI from different missions.  
 
17 5.3. Dataset requirements  for Copernicus Land ser vice over Europe  
The requirements for Copernicus Land service over Europe have been 
drafted within the following boundary conditions:  
 Requirements are based on the knowledge as of today of the pan -
European  and local Land service configuration for the refer ence year 
2015 +/ - 1 year.  Continuity of a series of existing services for the 
reference year 2012 +/ - 1 year are taken as a baseline, extended with 
requirements for the 2015 +/ -1 reference year.  
 Subject to adaptations as soon as the Sentinel data start to  become 
available: this is expected to considerably improve the acquisition 
possibilities, and therefore needs a distinction between the periods 
before and after  Sentinel data become available in nominal mode.  
 The land service portfolio for the 2018 +/ - 1 reference year is subject 
to partial continuity, partial changes, following the outcome of a 
(continuous) process of Land service evolution. The sensor offer will 
have substantially changed by then.  Both conditions entail the need for 
a revision before sta rting the 2018 (+/ - 1 y) reference year acquisitions.  
REQ -5.3.1 -1 Preserving spectral information  
Each optical CORE dataset shall be provided as a set of individual images 
(scenes) with separated spectral bands at pixel value (bundled with other 
products if requested  or offered ) to allow for the maximum level of 
flexibility in automated classification and visual interpretations, including  
future developments.  
REQ -5.3.1 -2 Standard Formats  
The delivery of e ach individual file in a dataset shall be provided in a 
single, common harmon ised format for level 2 and 3 products. From the 
start of the operational delivery of Sentinel -2 data, the delivery of CCME 
level 2 and 3 products shall meet a  standard file format  and structure  with 
complete and validated INSPIRE compliant  metadata , and a ccording to the 
standard file naming convention ( see Annex 2 ). 
The general aim of the harmonisation of file structure, metadata and 
naming shall be to facilitate automation of the retrieval and processing of 
the datasets, as much as possible on a common ba sis. 
Furthermore, from the start of the operational delivery of Sentinel -2 data, 
each dataset shall be accompanied by a data quality layer, encoded 
according to the specifications in Annex 7 . 
REQ -5.3.1 -3 Reference Year and Repetitiveness  
The acquisition campaigns shal l be repeated every 3 years taking the year 
2012 as starting reference year (n -3). To ensure the full coverage of the 
area of interest (AOI), the acquisition campaign shall start the year before 
(n-1). The overall objective shall be to acquire full coverag e of the AOI 
18 within the first 2 years. The year after (n+1) may be used for remaining 
gap-filling. Adjustment must be made to make optimal use of available 
SWIR sensors in particular in 2014.  
REQ -5.3.1 -4 Harmonised Cloud Cover delineation  
For procured optical imagery,  a common and consistent way of delineating 
and encoding Cloud Coverage and Cloud shadows  shall be  put in place, 
taking  into account the cloud fringe areas and treat separately the 
indication of cloud shadow areas  and the presence of haze  in order to 
allow  automatic processing of the data . Guidelines on how to identify 
typical C loud Coverage  issues are made available in Annex 9 . 
REQ -5.3.1 -5 Unique and single workflow monitoring tool  
To ensure an adequate management of each step in the full workflow of 
acquisition campa ign, pre -processing and information production over 
large territories and involving multiple stakeholder groups, it is mandatory 
to maintain the status of all key steps in the full cycle in a single master 
shape -file, constantly updated during the full cyc le of any acquisition 
campaign (yearly basis) with key attributes, allowing all to have access to 
the same comprehensive status overview.  
The acquired scenes shall be referred to in a master shape -file of the 
EEA39 countries in LAEA ETRS89 (EPSG code 3035)  as background 
layer, and comprising layers on a per -sensor and per -year basis.  Each layer 
shall contain ALL scene footprints taken into consideration for 
programming the acquisitions (each scene being the smallest spatial 
object).  
Separate layers shall be  added for gap -filling through archive retrieval 
and/or extensions to other sensors.  
Each footprint shall have as minimum the following list of attributes:  
 Identification of the scene ; 
 Date of acquisition ; 
 Status of pre -processing ; 
 Encoding of cloud cover ; 
 Encoding of haze ; 
 Encoding of technical quality of image ; 
 Availability in the data warehouse ; 
 Acceptation/rejection . 
19 Attributes shall be encoded in a semantically standardised structure, thus 
allowing easy search, selection, filtering and combination quer ies in order to 
facilitate management of the actual status of acquisitions.  
The master shape -file shall be managed by ESA, and constantly updated 
during the acquisition campaign by the CCMEs.  The master -file shall be 
accessible for all stakeholders in the process through a point of access  
facility  ensuring that all partners at any point of time are dealing with the 
same information content.  
REQ -5.3.1 -6 Success criteria and remuneration  
For all wall -to-wall optical CORE dataset acquisition campaigns, in order to 
maximis e the chances o f successful coverage matching the acquisition 
requirements, a new remuneration mechanism shall be applied. Simple per -
scene remuneration has shown not to be appropriate. Therefore a scheme 
shall be put in place, which, while encouraging dat a providers to acquire and 
deliver as much images as possible, will reward them in the end according to 
the quality of the best possible coverage accomplished.  
At the end of the acquisition campaign for any year, the data providers  
(CCMEs)  shall propose a mosaic composed of all scenes they consider 
matching the acquisition specifications, for assessing the quality parameters, 
which will determine the final pri ce. 
A total of five quality indicators will be evaluated based on the final mosaic:  
 Total coverage achieved;  
 Number of scenes required;  
 Average size of all areas composed of contiguously connected scenes;  
 Max size of the largest data gap (incl. clouds and snow, excl. 
perennial snow and glaciers);  
 RMS distance (in days) of acquisitions date from target d ate; 
 Max difference of acquisition date of adjacent pixels.  
An example of a  quality based pricing scheme is  provided in  Annex  8. 
5.3.2.  Optical HR Pan Europe coverage (HR_IMAGE_2015)  
Applications  
Main purposes: continuation of pan -European land services, includin g 
Corine Land Cover (CLC) and the production of High Resolution Layers 
(HRL) on land cover characteristics by the Union, EEA and Member States. 
These requirements could also partially meet EFFIS requirements.  
REQ -5.3.2 -1 Sensor acquisition characteristics  
20 Spatial reso lution: Sensors between 5m and maximum 30m GSD (ground 
sampling distance) shall be considered. (Remark: the acquisition pixel size is 
linked  with the fi nal data product resolution, see Data Product requirements 
below ). 
Spectral resolution: Optical multispe ctral sensors used for all 
HR_IMAGE_2015 acquisitions must have at least one independent spectral 
band centred in each of the following spectral ranges to allow optimal 
analysis of vegetation:  
Gree n [0.5 -0.6μm], Red [0.6 -0.68μm], NIR [0.7 -0.9μm], SWIR1 [ 1.5-
1.8μm]  
Radiometric resolution: minimum bit depth of 7 -bits signal dynamic range  is 
acceptable , higher bit depth is preferred  (e.g. 16 -bits). 
REQ -5.3.2 -2 Areas of Interest (AOI)  
The overall AOI of interest co mprises the EEA39 national territories to a 
total of ~6 M km². Within this Area a number of 'large regions'  have been 
delineated as acquisition subunits  as displayed in Annex  3. 
The overall AOI shall be extended by a 2 nautical miles buffer for the 2014 -
2015 acquisition campaign. From the operational availability of Sentinel -2 
onwards , the standard territorial water of 12 nautical miles into the sea/ocean 
shall be taken as the buffer.  
REQ -5.3.2 -3 Tasking and Acquisition – Objectives  
The objective of the wall -to-wall CO RE HR image acquisition is to cover 
once or twice the entire AOI (depending of the Zone) with:  
 The least possible number of scenes ; 
 Coming from the least possible sensors ; 
 Leaving only the smallest possible gaps and  
 Being acquired as close as possible to the respective reference date.  
Data acquisition shall start the year before the reference year.  The bulk of 
acquisitions shall be within the reference year.  The reference year +1 is only 
used for gap -filling, in which case those scenes would  receive an add itional 
7 days “off date” quality bias. In that case the increase in quality and 
coverage will determine the price . 
REQ -5.3.2 -4 Acquisition zones  
For the acquisition campaign, separate zones are identified in Annex 4  
covering a range of areas indicatively correspondin g with risk levels to 
acquire complete coverage. It comprises a Zone A for the cloudiest areas, 
Zone B for cloud -prone areas, Zone C for the areas with statistically limited 
cloud cover frequencies and Zone D for French DOM situated under the 
21 tropics. The requirements for Zone C apply to Zone B and D if not specified 
otherwise.  
To account for differences with respect to phenological effects and 
observation conditions (cloud probability, sun angles)  and the resulting 
difficulties to meet the quality requirem ents, each AOI subunit  is assigned to 
one of the following zones:  
Zone A:  a minimum  of one cloud -free coverage (VNIR + SWIR).  
Areas at northern latitudes and/or with very narrow phenological windows 
and or very difficult observation conditions.  
Zone B:  two cloud -free coverages (one VNIR + SWIR; second: preferably 
VNIR + SWIR, but VNIR only acceptable as second choice) . 
Areas at mid -latitudes with a high probability of suitable acquisition 
windows during the observation periods.  
Two target dates will be spec ified, however the completion of the second 
coverage is considered a best effort.  
Zone C:  two cloud -free coverages with preferably homogenous sensor 
VNIR + SWIR acquisitions . 
Areas at lower latitudes with extended phenological observation periods and 
predo minantly clear sky conditions during those.  
Two target dates will be specified and accordingly two coverages are 
expected.  
Zone D : one cloud -free coverage (VNIR + SWIR) . 
Overseas areas (e.g. French DOMs) . 
REQ -5.3.2 -5 Acquisition windows  
The acquisition windows are def ined in Annex 5  with extended and narrow 
windows. The starting and ending dates of these extended and narrow 
windows can be subject to modifications with a ten day advance notice to 
allow for extension of acquisition with an earlier start and/or later end.  
REQ -5.3.2 -6 Acquisition strategy  
Zone A:  One VNIR + SWIR coverage in the narrow windows of acquisition; 
multi -mission systematic tasking over the same areas to ensure adequate 
coverage of the cloudiest regions.  
Purchase criteria for Zone A: As a minimum, any part of acquisition (grid) 
with less than the high cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' 
requirements as long as it contributes to reaching the goal of one cloud free 
coverage of Zone A.  
22 Zone B:  A first and most important coverage including VNIR + SWIR shall 
be acquired during the narrow window of acquisition, preferably through 
systematic tasking of one sensor, complemented with speculative tasking 
from other sensors and/or outside the narrow window but still inside the 
extended window . 
The second cover age shall be acquired with ideall y 6 weeks, but minimally 
with a 4 week  time difference to the first coverage.  The second coverage can 
be either upfront or after the first coverage, but within the extended 
acquisition window. Preference is given to VNIR + SWIR. VNIR only is 
acceptable for the second coverage if SWIR is not available (second 
priority).  
Purchase criteria for Zone B: As a minimum, any part of the acquisition grid  
with less than the cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' 
requirements as long as it contributes to reaching the goal of completing 
Zone B.  
Zone C:  A first and most important coverage including VNIR + SWIR shall 
be acquired during the narrow window of acquisition.  
The second coverage shall be acquired with ideally 6 weeks, bu t minimally 
with a 4 week time  difference to the first coverage.  The second coverage can 
be either upfront or after the first coverage, but within the extended 
acquisition window. Preference is given to VNIR + SWIR. VNIR only is 
acceptable for the second c overage if SWIR is not available (second 
priority).  
Purchase criteria for Zone C: As a minimum, any part of the acquisition grid 
with less than the  cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' 
requirements  as long as it contributes to reaching the goal  of completing 
Zone C.  
Zone D:  One coverage including VNIR + SWIR shall be acquired during the 
extended window of acquisition.  
Purchase criteria for Zone D: As a minimum, any part of the acquisition grid 
with less than the cloud coverage defined in 'Cloud Cover and Haze ' 
requirements  as long as it contributes to reaching the goal of one cloud free 
coverage of Zone D.  
REQ -5.3.2 -7 Cloud Cover  and H aze 
The maximum cloud coverage allowed  is defined as per a grid of 25x25 km 
and varies per Zone A, B. C or D ( see Annex 4). It is also a function of the 
spatial distribution of the clouds on the scene (the presence of cloud spread 
all over the scene is not ac ceptable). This  restriction aims at reducing the 
number of scenes to be processed and ensuring processing homogeneity. See  
Guidelines in Annex 9 . 
23 The overall AOI comprising zones A, B, C, D will be subdivided in a 
uniform grid of 25 km cell side. Grid cells will, according to zone 
dependency, have a maximum allowed C loud Coverage  threshold as follows:  
 Zone A (cloudiest):  CC 2 0% max ; 
 Zone B (cloud prone): CC 10%  max; 
 Zones C/D (limited cloud): CC 5% max.  
Scenes comprising haze shall be flagged accordingly for further 
consideration, and are subject to rejection by the Copernicus service 
coordinator, in consultation with the serv ice providers implementing the land 
services.  
Presence of perennial snow and glaciers is allowed.  However, temporary 
snow, saturated pixels and data gaps have to be included for the above listed 
calculation of the max. allowed percentages.  
REQ -5.3.2 -8 Illumination/Rad iometry  
The sun elevation angle shall be higher than 20° to ensure sufficient 
illumination  and to minimize the effect of shadows . 
The off -nadir viewing angle shall be less than 2 5°. 
Saturated pixels, snow (excl. perennial), clouds and areas with a signal t o 
noise ratio of less than 50:1 (at 35% ground reflectance) will count as data 
gaps.  
REQ -5.3.2 -9 Selection and rejection of scenes  
The data provider must assess the quality of the datasets.  
It is up to the service coordinator, in consultation with the service provider s 
to review the scenes proposed by the CCMEs at the end of the acquisition 
campaign on their appropriateness for further processing.  
REQ -5.3.2 -10 Processing  Levels  
The scenes shall be provided with two different levels of processing:  
Level2 (ortho -rectified to ETRS89/E TRS-LAEA)) : 
 Ortho-rectified at -sensor radiance values (resampled using cubic 
convolution method) ; 
 GCP file with respect to reference data set ; 
 INSPIRE compliant m etadata . 
Level1 (system correction) : 
24  System corrected and at -sensor radiometric and geometric calibrated 
data; 
 Ortho layer, (i.e. x, y coordinates (ETRS89) ) INSPIRE compliant 
metadata . 
REQ -5.3.2 -11 Radiometric and atmospheric correction  
A cascade approach may be considered for radiometric and atmospheric 
corrections in decreasing order of priority as follows:  
(a) Atmospheric corrected Surface Reflectance (or Bottom of Atmosphere 
(BOA)), 16 -bit data. However this option requires a well-established  
method. Atmospheric bands in Sentinel -2 will allow for that, entailing 
that this option only be considered from Sentinel -2 onwards.  
(b) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) planetary reflectances, 16 -bit data.  Sensor 
specific in band  solar irradiance values (ESUN) shall be provided.  
(c) ESUN corrected but not solar elevation corrected.  
(d) Radiometric calibrated data with calibration parameters enab ling the 
conversion of image digital numbers (DN) into spectral radiance 
(W/m2/sr/um) . Solar spectral irradiances within each spectral band 
and the solar elevation for each scene  are required to  convert the 
image DNs into TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) reflectanc e values . 
REQ -5.3.2 -12 Ortho -rectification  
 Ortho ready processing shall include basic corrections such as 
rectilinear  geometry, radiometric distortion (i.e. source data) . 
 Ortho -rectification has to be full -parametric or making use of RPC 
functions and shall be based on  the EU -DEM. In case a different DEM 
is used it must be supplied with the data.  
 European projection is required for all coverage ETRS89, LAEA 
(EPSG code 3035). National projection is optional and may be 
requested on a case by case basis.  
 Grid alignment: Ge oTIFF key: The GeoTIFF key 
"GTRasterTypeGeoKey" shall have the value 1, corresponding to 
"RasterPixelIsArea".  
 Pixel alignment: The values of the coordinates for the upper -left 
corner (x and y) of the upper -left pixel of an image dataset shall be an 
integer  multiple of the pixel size (resolution) in the corresponding 
direction (x and y).  
 Ortho -rectification accuracy:  
o Relative accuracy (2014 -2015): Reference less than 1 pixel 
difference with HR_IMAGE_2012.  
25 o Absolute accuracy (from S2 onwards): Ortho -rectificat ion must 
be accurate to less than 0.75 pixel size equivalent RMSE and a 
max displacement of less than 1.5 pixels in no more than 0.1% 
of any 50x50sqkm area within the AOI with respect to the 
reference data set.  
REQ -5.3.2 -13 Data Products  
Optical multispectral HR data p roducts with a 20 m pixel resolution. GSD of 
the sensor shall be no worse than 1. 5 times the product raster width . 
From the operational availability of Sentinel -2 onwards, HR products will be 
delivered at 10 m pixel resolution.  
Level 2 products shall be pr ovided according to standard and harmonised 
format specifications ( see Annex 2 ). 
REQ -5.3.2 -14 Delivery  
Zone A : After selection , delivery will be made no later than 60 days after 
selection.  
Zone B : To the extent that systematic tasking has been applied for a sensor 
over Zone B, the same delivery requirement shall be maintained as for zone 
A. For non -systematic acquisitions d elivery shall be  made  on a continuous 
basis, but no later than 60 days after the end of the extended acquisition 
window s. 
Zones C:  Delivery shall be made on a continuous basis, but no later than 60 
days after the end of the extended acquisition window s. 
For all zones, delivery shall be made per large scale regions (acquisition 
subunits defined in Annex 3 ). 
REQ -5.3.2 -15 Licensing  (for datasets with restrictive licen sing conditions)  
Multi -user DOWNLOAD and VIEW licences shall be acquired to cover as a 
baseline all relevant activities of users in [Copernicus Services ], 
[Union_Inst ], [Union_Research _Proj ects] and [Public_Authorities].  
[INT_ORG_NGO ] and [Public]  shall ha ve access in DISCOVERY mode.  
VIEW mode should however be considered an option towards 
[INT_ORG_NGO ] and will be used if affordable . 
5.3.3.  Optical VHR multispectral and panchromatic coverage over Europe 
(VHR_IMAGE_2015)  
Applications  
Land local component applicati ons for hotspots, i.e. specific areas of interest 
at pan -European level (EEA39) (land cover over riparian zones for the 
purpose of biodiversity monitoring, monitoring of coastal areas, risk areas, 
26 protected areas (Natura 2000 sites), Land Parcel Identifica tion…) and at 
national level . 
Land local component applications over hotspots at pan -European level 
(Urban Atlas, Land Parcel Identification…) and at national level . 
REQ -5.3.3 -1 Sensor acquisition characteristics  
Spatial resolution: pixel sizes up to maximum 2m shall be considered. 
(Remark: the acquisition pixel size is linked with the final data product 
resolution, (see. Data Product requirements below )). 
Spectral resolution: Optical multispectral sensors used for all 
VHR_IMAGE_2015 acquisitions must have at least one  independent 
spectral band centred in each of the following spectral ranges to allow 
optimal analysis of vegetation:  
Green [0.5 -0.6μm], Red [0.6 -0.68μm], NIR [0.7 -0.9μm] . 
Panchromatic [0.45 -0.85μm] . 
SWIR1 [ 1.5-1.8μm] is considered optional.  The availabilit y of sensor 
capacities allowing for systematic inclusion without jeopardising other 
requirements shall trigger an investigation by ESA on the feasibility of 
revision of specifications to include SWIR.  
Radiometric resolution: minimum bit depth of 7 -bit signal dynamic range  is 
acceptable, higher bit depth is preferred , e.g. 16 -bit depth.  
REQ -5.3.3 -2 Areas of Interest (AOI)  
The overall AOI of interest comprises the EEA39 national territories to a 
total of ~6 M km² . 
The overall AOI shall be extended by a 2 nautical miles b uffer.  
REQ -5.3.3 -3 Tasking and Acquisition  
Objectives:  
The objective of the wall -to-wall CORE VHR image acquisition is to cover 
once the entire AOI with:  
 The least possible number of scenes ; 
 Coming from the least possible sensors ; 
 Leaving only the smallest possible g aps and  
 Being acquired as close as possible to the respective reference date.  
Data acquisition shall start the year before the reference year.  The bulk of 
acquisitions shall be within the reference year.  The reference year +1 is only 
used for gap -filling,  in which case those scenes will receive an additional 7 
27 days “off date” quality bias. In that case the increase in quality and coverage 
will determine the price . 
REQ -5.3.3 -4 Acquisition windows  
The acquisition windows are defined in Annex 5  with extended and  narrow 
windows. The starting and ending dates of these extended and narrow 
windows can be subject to modifications with a ten day  advance notice to 
allow for extension of acquisition with an earlier start and/or later end.  
REQ -5.3.3 -5 Acquisition  Strategy  
The acquisition stra tegy shall take into account the knock -on effects of 
scattered footprint patterns (i.e. different sensors, different years, different 
seasons), having a multiplicative effect on the coherence and size of working 
units as a collection of images with suffici ently stable characteristics to 
automate classification processes on single selection of areas. This entails 
optimisation of series of acquisitions with regard to the areas as defined in  
Annex 4 . 
REQ -5.3.3 -6 Cloud Cover and Haze  
The maximum cloud coverage allowed per scene is function of the swath of 
the sensor and the percentage of cloud de fined per Zone A, B,  C or D ( see. 
Annex 4) . The maximum cloud coverage allowed per scene is also function  
of the spatial distribution of the clouds on the scene (the presence of clo ud 
spread all over the scene is not acceptable). This restriction aims at reducing 
the number of scenes to be processed and ensuring processing homogeneity.  
The overall AOI comprising zones A, B, C, D will be subdivided in a 
uniform grid of side 25 km. Gri d cells will, according to zone dependency, 
have a maximum allowed C loud Coverage (CC)  threshold as follows:  
 Zone A (cloudie st): CC 20% max ; 
 Zone B (cloud prone): CC 10% max ; 
 Zones C/D (limited cloud): CC 5% max.  
Scenes comprising haze shall be flagged acc ordingly for further 
consideration, and are subject to rejection by the Copernicus service 
coordinator, in consultation with the service providers implementing the land 
services.  
Presence of perennial snow and glaciers is allowed.  However, temporary 
snow, saturated pixels and data gaps have to be included for the abov e listed 
calculation of the maximum  allowed percentages.  
REQ -5.3.3 -7 Illumination/Radiometry  
The sun elevation angle shall be higher than 20° (preferable higher than 23°) 
to ensure sufficient illumination  and to minimize the effect of shadows . 
28 The off -nadir viewing angle shall be less than 30°. 
Saturated pixels, snow (excl. perennial), clouds and areas with a signal to 
noise ratio of less than 50:1 (at 35% ground reflectance) will count as data 
gaps.  
REQ -5.3.3 -8 Select ion and rejection of scenes  
The data provider (CCME) must assess the quality of the datasets.  
The service coordinator, in consultation with the service providers, maintains  
the right to reject scenes that are not suited for further processing.  
REQ -5.3.3 -9 Processing l evels  
The scenes shall be provided with two different levels of processing:  
Level 2  (ortho -rectified to ETRS89/ETRS -LAEA)) : 
 Ortho-rectified at -sensor radiance values (resampled using cubi c 
convolution method);  
 GCP file wi th respect to reference data set;  
 INSPIRE compliant m etadata . 
Level 1  (system correction) : 
 System corrected and at -sensor radiometri c and geometric calibrated 
data;  
 Ortho layer, (i.e. x, y coordinates (ETRS89 ) INSPIRE compliant 
metadata . 
REQ -5.3.3 -10 Radiometric and atmospheric correction  
A cascade appr oach may be considered for radiometric and atmospheric 
corrections in decreasing order of priority as follows:  
(a) Atmospheric corrected Surface Reflectance (or Bottom of Atmosphere 
(BOA)), 16 -bit data. However this option requires a well-established  
method. A tmospheric bands in Sentinel -2 will allow for that, entailing 
that this option only be considered from Sentinel -2 onwards.  
(b) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) planetary reflectances, 16 -bit data.  Sensor 
specific in band  solar irradiance values (ESUN) shall be provided . 
(c) ESUN corrected but not solar elevation corrected.  
(d) Radiometric calibrated data with calibration parameters enabling the 
conversion of image digital numbers (DN) into spectral radiance 
(W/m2/sr/um) . Solar spectral irradiances within each spectral band 
and the solar elevation for each scene  are required to  convert the 
image DNs into TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) reflectance values . 
29 REQ -5.3.3 -11 Ortho -rectification  
 Ortho ready processing shall include basic corrections such as 
rectilinear  geometry, radiometric distortion (i.e. source data) . 
 Ortho -rectification has to be full -parametric or making use of RPC 
functions and shall be based on the EU -DEM. In case a different DEM

5.3.4.  European optical MR1 composites (MR_IMAGE_2015)  
Application  
Pan-European land services and EFFIS .  
Intra-seasonal time series are essential for the production of High Resolution 
Layers (HRL) on land cover characteristics by the Union, EEA and Member 
States, in particular for vegetation related discrimination of characte ristics, 
such as grasslands or semi -natural vegetation.  
These requirements could also partially meet EFFIS requirements . 
REQ -5.3.4 -1 Sensor acquisition characteristics  
Spatial resolution: Sensors between 30m and maximum 60m GSD shall be 
considered. (Remark: the acquis ition pixel size links with the fi nal data 
product resolution, see Data Products  below) . 
Spectral resolution: Optical multispectral sensors used for all 
MR_IMAGE_2015 acquisitions must have at least one independent spectral 
band centred in each of the foll owing spectral ranges to allow optimal 
analysis of vegetation:  
Green [0.5 -0.6μm], Red [0.6 -0.68μm], NIR [0.7 -0.9μm], SWIR1 [ 1.5-

minimum 3, better 5 and optimally 8 monthly composites of  the entire AOI 
with:  
 The least possible number of scenes ; 
 Coming from the least possible sensors ; 
 Leaving only the smallest possible gaps and  
Data acquisition shall start the year before t he reference year.  The bulk of 
acquisitions shall be within the reference year.  The reference year +1 is only 
used for gap -filling, in which case those scenes will receive an additional 7 
days “off date” quality bias. In that case the increase in quality a nd coverage 
will determine the reimbursement.  
REQ -5.3.4 -4 Acquisition  windows  
March to October within the same year.  
In order of priority, composites over the following subgroups of months are 
important:  
1. June-July

5.5. Fixed / CORE Dataset requirements for marine,  atmosphere, climate 
change applicati ons 
Remarks:  
 Only data provided within stringent timeliness requirements  (cut-
off) can be used to enter data assimilation and data monitoring 
procedures  in pre -operational and operational systems and contribute 
to the forecast production.  
 The domain covere d is global, except in the case of geostationary 
satellites, which have only regional coverage.  
 To ensure tr ansparency and traceability, a  requirement imposed on 
data used for the production of climate reanalyses is that the original 
input observations, to gether with metadata about uncertainties, can 
be made available for research purposes without restriction. To avoid 
43 complex data policy issues , only free-of-charge input data are 
therefore used for the main current climate reanalysis production.

5.7. Flexible / ADDITIONAL  datasets requirements  
Dataset s in rush mode will mainly serve the objectives of the Copernicus 
Emergency Management Service and the Security service. Both archived 
data and new tasked satellite data (new acquisitions) shall be made available.  
The objective of datasets in standard mode is  to allow beneficiaries to access 
contributing mission archives in optical  and SAR MR1, HR1/2 and VHR1/2  
resolutions in order to be able, for example, to build time series, make 
comparisons and to feed users with new ADDITIONAL images both, for 
emergency a nd security (outside crisis phase) services as well as for the 
different components of the Land Monitoring service, in particular VHR 
images for global land.  
48 ADDITIONAL  datasets  also serve [Union_Research_Projects ]. 
Archived CORE datasets shall be used whe re fulfilling the user 
requirements.  
ADDITIONAL datasets are split into categories, according to their 
timeliness requireme nts: rush mode or standard mode with the following 
possible characteristics: resolution, optical/SAR, archive/new acquisition.  
5.7.1.  Over all requirements are:  
REQ -5.7.1 -1 ADDITIONAL datasets shall be provided in order to serve the objectives

6.1. Datasets to be considered for future requirements  
6.1.1.  Video datasets  
The p rovision of video datasets  in the future is an interesting development 
for example in the context of Copernicus EMS. It is however expected that 
the integration of video datasets in the data warehouse would have technical 
consequences  substantially differe nt from  the integration of still datasets  
from new contributing missions . It is therefore necessary that ESA  conduct 
an analysis on the feasibility of such integration and its consequences.

Cloud cover assessment and zones delineation  
In order to divide Europe in three zones with respect to cloud probability, a n approach based on spatial and temporal interpolation was 
implemented. The processing was done on a 25km sized grid covering all Europe, by considering as input two sources of multi -year cloud 
cover statistics: the first was obtained from OAK RIDGE NATION AL LABORATORY – Distributed Active Archive Center, con taining  data 
over a period of more than 30 years (from 1960 to 1991) ; the second was calculated from 8 years of daily MODIS data (from 2006 to 2013).  
The acquisition window, narrow and extended, define d in Copernicus DWH 2014 -2020 were considered as input data and used to temporarily 
“spatialize” cloud probability over the grid cells. The results obtained from the two cloud cover statistics were then averag ed on a cell -per-cell 
basis and a simple classi fication scheme was used to assign to each cell one of three zones based on the cloud cover probability inside the 
narrow acquisition window.  
The following map shows the result obtained considering these cloud probability ranges: zone C [0,40], zone B (40, 65] and zone A (65,100] . 
Zone A has been extended to cover the full group of Northern countries, in order to fully take into account the short summer season and 
shallow sun angles, which equally limit chances on successful acquisitions, and therefore requi re a more intensive acquisition strategy.  
These three zones are used to implement a remuneration schema that takes into account how difficult it is to obtain a cloud -free coverage in the different 
parts of Europe.

 Annex 9.  EXAMPLES OF TYPICAL C LOUD COVER AND HAZE SITUATIONS   
An in -depth analysis carried out on a database of satelli te images obtained from various 
sensors has led to the determination of a classification of the problems that typically 
occur . These pro blems arise  in the images wi th different orders of gravity and may limit 
or completely compromise the profitable use of the images themselves. The identified 
classes are the following:  
1) Almost transparent  haze  
2) Semi -transparent  haze /clouds  
3) Cloud s 
4) Shadow s 
5) Snow  
Below we provide some typical examples for each of the above classes :
