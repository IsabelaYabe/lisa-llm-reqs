CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City – Final |1 Chapter 1.  Introduction 
This document describes the System Requirements Specification (SyRS) for the New York City 
Department of Transportation (NYC) Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment (CVPD) Project. This SyRS 
describes the results of the definition of need, the operational concept, and system analysis tasks. It 
also conveys the requirements that are geared towards satisfying the needs of the users and 
stakeholders of the system.  
 
It is the first of several planning documents for t he CVPD  Program, Phase 1 project funded by the 
United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).  Other planning documents, developed under this project phase, that influenc e this SyRS include the Concept of Operations (ConOps), Security 
Management Operational Concept, Performance Measurement and Evaluation Plan, Safety Management Plan, and Human Use Approval.  
 
Two other project phases are scheduled following the successful completion of Phase 1.  Phase 2 
consists of the design, deploy ment , and test activities occurring over a 20- month period.  A maintain 
and operate period comprises Phase 3 of the project over an 18- month period.  
 
The document is organized to meet  the requirements of the USDOT System Engineering Process  and 
IEEE 1 233-1998 as required by the USDOT Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)  dated January 30, 
2015 am ended.  
1.1 System Purpose  
The fundamental message of the N ew York City (NYC)  Vision Zero initiative is that death and injury on 
City streets is not acceptable. These tragedies happen in every community within NYC, to families from 
every walk of life – from the Upper East Side to the Lower East Side; from Park Slope to Edenwald. 
They happen to people who drive and to those who bike, but overwhelmingly, the deadly toll is highest 
for pedestrians – especially children and seniors. The goal of Vision Zero is to eliminate traffic deaths 
by 2024.   The NYC CVPD  project will focus on safet y improvements for both motorists and non-
motorists. In particular, the crash risks increase during nighttime hours when vehicle speeds tend to be higher and it becomes more difficult for vehicle drivers to see pedestrians crossing the roadway.  
 
As the sa fety statistics indicate, surface improvements on city streets alone will not mitigate the number 
of crashes, fatalities, and severe injuries long -term. While no “Silver Bullet” will end all crashes, multiple 
supplemental tools are needed that can work tog ether to attain Vision Zero’s goal . The connected 
vehicle (CV) technology is one of these tools and it presents a systematic approach in alerting vehicles 
of unsafe roadway conditions and prevents collisions with other vehicles  and pedestrians. It will provide 
numerous safety benefits that facilitate Vision Zero's goals and initiatives .

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |2 1.2 System Scope  
NYC is implementing the CV  technology as another tool in its quest for Vision Zero.  It is anticipated 
that the CV technology will reduce the number of and seve rity of crashes in the deployment area.  In 
addition to deploying the technology, New York City will assess its impacts and potential for attaining 
the Vision Zero goal of zero crashes/fatalities/injuries. Figure 1-1.  NYC CVPD System  Concept  in 
Section 1.5, System Overview , provides a conceptual view of the system to be deployed.  It also 
provides insight to whether a component exists or will be newly deployed within the project.  
 
The NYC CVPD project is one of three initial CV deployment projects that establish a base for growing 
a nation- wide connected vehicle system.  As such, its focus is on utilizing standards to build basic 
infrastructure in a manner that provides a foundation for future deployments of connected vehicle 
technology.  
 
The NYC CVPD project provides  a real demonstration and evaluation of the benefits of the CV 
technology in a dense urban environment.   NYC has deployed a robust infrastructure with advanced 
traffic  controllers ( ATC) , an advanced adaptive traffic signal control system which currently uses travel 
times as part of its operational algorithms, an aggressive maintenance program, and a ubiquitous high 
speed wireless network (NYCWiN). By deploying Aftermark et Safety Devices (ASD)  and Roadside 
Units (RSU), our team can bring the benefits of the CV paradigm to NYC’s Vision Zero initiative and 
provide the opportunity to evaluate the benefits with a significant number of vehicles that are regularly driving in the area.  
 This project will also provide the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) the opportunity to showcase 
the benefits of CV technology without replacing the vehicle fleet –  which is likely to be the situation for 
many years to come.  At the same time,  the NYC CVPD will be used to demonstrate the benefits to 
vulnerable road users who suffer the most from roadway fatalities in NYC.  
 In the ConOps, the system needs were developed for the following users: traffic manager, fleet 
owners, roadway users, and s ystem manager. They  are presented using two perspectives – the 
NYCDOT traffic management needs and the stakeholders (i.e. fleet owners, driver/op erators) needs 
for deploying, maintaining, and operating connected vehicle technology to be installed on their vehicles.  Other needs for operating and maintaining the infrastructure (i.e. core services) are also 
identified.  Each system need is identified with a unique number for tracing through the system 
development life cycle (SDLC). For each need, a set of syst em requirements are developed to provide 
the needed services for the users and stakeholders of the NYC CVPD.  
 
The improvements provided by this  project are summarized in the following list:  
• Vehicle fleets equipped with ASD s for Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC).  
• Initial intersections equipped with RSU for DSRC communications.  
• Initial curves, entrance/exit ramps, and work zones equipped with RSUs . 
• Fleet terminal facility areas equipped with RSU for DSRC communications.  
• Significant deployment of CV safety applications.  
• New applications for managing DSRC devices from over -the-air (OTA) updates to radio 
frequency link monitoring.

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |3 The original scope of NYC CV Pilot deployment project included deploying ASDs to 10,000 vehic les, 
RSUs at 300 locations, and PIDs for 100 visually -impaired pedestrian users. However, many of the 
initial stakeholder organizations that had expressed interest in the NYC CV pilot program  did not 
continue their support . Hence, organizations such as TLC , taxi fleets, UPS, and DSNY ended up 
deciding not to participate. MTA allowed installation in eleven (11) of its buses, but ultimately it also 
chose to discontinue allowing further ASD installations in its buses.   
This led to NYCDOT choosing NYC or DCAS fleets for partnering with other agencies to bring in more 
vehicles for installation. Therefore, the total number of ASD deployments became 3,000 vehicles while 
the number of RSU deployments increased to 450.  In addition, the pedestrian application for the  PID 
to be used by visually -impaired pedestrians encountered many issues that led to delays as well. The 
PID deployment number was also decreased from 100 devices to 10 prototype PIDs to be used for 
testing and evaluation  of the technology . 
 Also, procurin g turnkey devices proved to be challenging. This led to delays in release, testing, and 
validation of prototype and production devices. The amount of time and effort expended into 
procurement, testing, and validation has been well above the original expect ations made during 
planning stages of the NYC CV pilot project.  Additional details can be found in the As -Built Addendum 
section at the end of this document.

Protocol Data Unit (PDU)  A defined data structure that is transferred at a peer level between correspondi ng 
software entities functioning at the same layer in the OSI standard model which 
are operating on different computing platforms that are interconnected via 
communications media .  
Public Key  In cryptography, a public key is a value provided by some desig nated authority 
as an encryption key that, combined with a private key derived from the public 
key, can be used to effectively encrypt messages and digitally sign them. The use of combined public and private keys is known as asymmetric cryptography. 
A syst em for using public keys is called a public key infrastructure (PKI).

1.5  System Overview  
This project brings New York City  (NYC)  another step ahead towards reaching the Vision Zero goal of 
eliminating the injuries and fatalities due to traffic crashes.  The project's concept is simple - it 
introduces CV technology and communications into the NYC  travel environment by equipping several 
large vehicle fleets with the technology and equips several areas with the corresponding connected 
vehicle infrastructure.

It is important to understand the implications of the connected vehicle technology deployment in New 
York City.  A small portion of NYC roadway network will have connected vehicle infrastructure installed 
(i.e. 450 Roads ide Unit (RSU)  locations).  Vehicle- to-Infrastructure (V2I) applications such as Red 
Light Violation Warning, Speed Compliance, and Curve Speed Compliance will support connected vehicles operating in these areas.  However, the geographic reach of the connected vehicle 
technology is much broa der.  Vehicles equipped with connected vehicle technology (i.e. ASDs ) will 
travel in this infrastructure equipped area and throughout the City’s transportation network .  Thus the 
connected vehicle technology that supports Vehicle -to-Vehicle (V2V) application s will function 
anywhere two equipped vehicles are within range of one another.  Equipped vehicle encounters may 
occur on the surface streets, in the tunnels and bridges crossing the rivers, at the airports, and on the 
City’s higher speed facilities such as the FDR Drive and the Long Island Expressway.  The large fleet 
size means that there will be many opportunities for the connected vehicle technology to perform over 
a large geographic area and diverse roadway environments.  
 
Figure 1-1 depicts the envisioned NYC CVPD system and the boundary between the internal system 
and the external systems and components that interface with the NYC CVPD environment. The ASDs, RSU s, PIDs, data collection/processing system, NYCWiN, and VRU detection system are in 
the NYC CVPD system. The TCS, ATC, GNSS, TIS, DMS, FM Radio, and other CV support systems 
including the SCMS are the external systems and components.

The existing system elements, critical to the operation of the pilot system, are illustrated with beige 
backgrounds. These existing elements include the traffic control system (TCS), traffic controller (ATC), 
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Traveler Information System (TIS), Dynamic Message 
Signs (DMS), FM radio, and supporting New York City's wireless network (NYCWiN) communications 
infrastructure. The n ew system elements which exist and will be reused, modified, or integrated into 
the NYC CVPD system contain green backgrounds. They comprise of the ASDs in light -duty vehicle, 
bus, and commercial vehicle, RSU s, PIDs , data collection/processing system, and other CV support 
systems including the Security Credential Management System (SCMS). The Vulnerable Road User (VRU) detection devices are shown with a blue background. They are relatively new and will be deployed to the system on a very limited basis.  
 NYC’s initial system deployment is anticipated to be the largest CV technology deployment to date.  It 
is anticipated that approximately 281 intersections in Manhattan and 28 intersections along Flatbush 
Avenue in Brooklyn will be instrumented with RSUs to communicate with up to 3,000 vehicles  
equipped with ASDs.  These devices will monitor communications with other connected vehicles and 
the infrastructure and provide aler ts to vehicle drivers/operators.  Other  RSUs will be installed at 
locations to support s ystem management functions such as providing security credentials, managing

Description 
The NYC CVPD system will consist of the specifi c subsystems in Figure 1-1 in the previous section. It 
will also interact with external components, interfaces, and systems shown in Figure 2-1.  While some 
external systems are being developed at this time by USDOT, they will become fully functional as the 
NYC CVPD project phase is completed.   The Security Credential Management System (SCMS), 
Operational Data Environment (ODE), and Object Registration Discovery Service (ORDS) are expected to be developed and provided by the USDOT.  The Location and Time Source (LTS), Service Monitor (SM) System, and Wide Area Information Disseminator (WAID) will be provided by 
NYCDOT  as the owner of the NYC CVPD system.  
2.1  System Context  
Figure 2-1 provides a detailed context of the NYC CVPD system. It defines the technical subsystems 
and interfaces that cross the system boundaries and the high -level interactions among the various 
components.  
 The left side of the context diagram represents the vehicles equipped with ASD and DSRC 
communication and their internal data bus. The right s ide identifies the traffic signal system, the 
advanced traffic signal controllers, and the National Weather Service (NWS) that will feed external 
data and DSRC messages to the NYC CVPD system. The top part of the diagram shows the location 
augmentation for  maintaining the V2XLocate positioning system  via RSU triangulation/trilateration, the 
GNSS for synchronizing the GPS time and position data (latitude, longitude, elevation), and the 
Network Time Reference for transmitting the Network Time Protocol (NTP) messages. The bottom 
portion of the diagram presents the SCMS for maintaining the security credentials, the Object 
Registration and Discovery Service (ORDS) for object registration and search, Operational Data 
Environment (ODE)  for distribution of CV data, and Research Data Exchange (RDE) for exchange of 
Independent Evaluator (IE) performance data with USDOT.   The ODE has replaced the Data 
Distribution System (DDS) as the platform for routing the data from multiple data sources to a 
common, integrated format  for subscribers to software applications such as CV applications.  
However, at this time the USDOT ODE is not expected to play a role and interact directly with the NYC CVPD system.

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |23 2.1.1  DSRC Communication with Vehicles  
All vehicles participating in the NYC CVPD will be equipped with ASDs. The ASDs will communicate 
with the Vehicle Communications Bus (CAN, J1939) and obtain vehicle behavior information (i.e. hard braking, steering wheel angle, transmission positi on, etc.). Based on the data collected, the DSRC -
equipped vehicles will transmit messages in the form of BSMs to nearby RSUs, which will then forward it to the NYCDOT TMC for initial post -processing.  
2.1.2  Location and Time  
In the NYC CVPD system, location augmentation will occur through corrections via V2XLocate 
technology that uses RSU triangulation/trilateration. As shown in Figure 2-1, the ASD and RSU will 
depend on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or Global Positioning System (GPS) time source for determining their time and position (latitude, longitude, and elevation). The Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) messages will serve as an external time source for synchronizing the location and time of non -CV equipment (i.e. Advanced Solid -State Traffic Controllers (ASTC), Traffic Control System 
(TCS), National Weather Ser vice (NWS)) with the NYC CVPD infrastructure.  
2.1.3  Existing External  Systems  
The National Weather Service (NWS) data on existing weather conditions will be captured and  tied to 
the recorded CV application event data.  To further remove the possibility of unusual weather events to particular dates, the precise nature of the weather events may be summarized as sunny, cloudy, 
light rain, heavy rain, light snow, heavy snow (or similar) instead of precise precipitation amounts or 
rates.  
 ASTC is the standard traffic signal controller device used in NYC. The controllers will be provisioned with CV capabilities to be able to exchange DSRC messages (i.e. SPaT, MAP,) with the NYC CVPD 
system. They will be monitored and controlled by Traffic Control System (TCS) which also  will 
communicate with the RSUs and monitor their operational status.  
2.1.4  Performance Measurement  
The USDOT ODE will be responsible for collecting, processing, and distributing near real -time CV 
data such as BSM, MAP, SPaT, and TIM messages. It will link the d ata produced by the roadway 
users with the USDOT situation data clearinghouse and warehouse facilities.  In the NYC CVPD 
system, the NYCDOT TMC will post -process and obfuscate the time, date, and location data in the 
BSMs received by the vehicles and SPaT,  MAP, and TIM messages broadcasted by the RSUs. It will 
utilize its own algorithm to aggregate, sanitize, and strip the data of any PII.  At this time, the USDOT 
ODE is not expected to play a role and interact directly with the NYC CVPD.  
 The Research Data Exchange (RDE) is USDOT ITS -JPO's web-based data resource for its  real-time 
Connected Data Systems (CDS) program which collects, manages, and provides archived and real -
time multi -source and multi -modal data to support the development and testing of ITS applications.  
The post -processed data from the NYC CVPD system will be sent to USDOT's Independent Evaluator 
(IE) for additional performance measurement analysis.   After this process, the IE may elect to share 
the data on the ODE.

Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |24 2.1.5  Security  
The USDOT SCMS  represents the interconnected NYC CV system that enable trusted 
communications between the ASDs, RSUs, and the TMC to protect the system and its data from 
unauthorized access.  It will support the secure distribution, use, and revocation of security credenti als 
in the NYC CVPD.   Currently, it is being developed by USDOT for utilization in the three pilot sites.  
 
The back office facilities at NYCDOT Traffic Management Center (TMC) will not be used for the 
security credentials management system (SCMS) functions , security enrollment certificates signing, 
and DSRC messages (BSM, SPaT, MAP, TIM) signing.  Instead, these operations will be allocated to 
the field RSUs as supported by the latest USDOT RSU specification.  Another option for consideration 
entailed utili zing a separate RSU within the TMC in lieu of the back office proxy server for managing 
the SCMS and signing of the enrollment certificates, pseudonym certificates, and safety messages 
transmitted by the devices.  However, the method of allowing individual  RSUs to sign the data has 
been selected to mitigate risks on schedule and cost.  
 
The ORDS will provide registration and look -up services for allowing objects to locate other objects in 
the CV environment for communication purposes. It will be used to prov ide registration and discovery 
services for enabling the secure data transfer applications in the NYC CVPD.  
2.2 System Modes and States  
2.2.1  Operational Modes  
The NYC CVPD system will operate in either online or offline mode as  shown in Table 2-1 below .

2.2.2  Operational States  
During NYC CVPD's normal operation,  the CV device will be able to communicate via DSRC to and/or 
from the device.  For performance evaluation purposes, i t will operate in  either active or silent state as 
shown in Table 2-5.

2.2.3  Operational Configuration 
The NYC CVPD system devices will operate with the following parameter types:  
• Control parameter : determines when to operate a particular device  
• Configuration parameter : determines how to operate (e.g. time delays, distances) a particular 
device  
• Recording parameter : determines what information for how long a particular device will record  
 Specific de tails about each parameter can be found in Section 2.3.1.2 . 
2.3  Major System Capabilities  
This section provides an overview of the major capability groupings for the NYC CVPD system requirements. Based on Figure 2-1 above, it describes the c ontextual components of the NYC CVPD  
system.

In the NYC CVPD system, the ASDs will send and receive DSRC safety messages through multiple 
V2V and V2I safety applications. They will be equipped with a speaker for warning the driver, an Ethernet port for maintenance, and power button. They will communicate with the Vehicle Data Bus 
(CAN, J1939) for gathering the vehicle behavior information and GPS for time and location source.

subsystems, and external systems via DSRC. The host vehicle's ASD will transmit BSMs to and from 
other vehicle ASDs and receive SPaT, MAP, and TIM messages through DSRC channel 172. For 
tuning the safety applications to the NYC traffic environment, the control, configuration, and recording parameters will be downloaded from the Parameter Management appli cation to the ASD via DSRC 
channels 174 and 176. As it collects event logs based on warnings from safety applications, it will 
upload them to the Event Collect application in the designated RSUs via DSRC channels 180 and 
182. This exchange will occur as the ASDs enter the range of a particular RSU and receive the WAVE 
Service Advertisement (WSA) message from the RSU via DSRC channel 178 at 5.9 GHz. The Event 
Collect application will manage performance data, maintenance and operation data, and IE log data.

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |29 The ASD will run multiple V2X safety applications, and threat arbitration will determine which 
application takes priority over others instead of allowi ng multiple applications to be triggered and notify 
the driver at once. The Event Record application will log event records from the safety application triggers, including the BSM, location reference and time, and accelerometer information from the 
Vehicle Performance Monitor application. It will send the event records to the In -Vehicle Temporary 
Recording module then to the Upload Log Support function for transmitting the log data to the 
designated RSUs.  
2.3.1.1  Event Collection  
The ASD will log the information before and after a particular event. The number of seconds before 
and after each event is to be determined, and it may depend on the type of warning generated by the 
ASD. What data is recorded will be subject to whether OBD -II/CAN bus is accessible and what data is 
produced by the ASD. This performance log data is expected to include time and location information 
from the BSMs, the warning issued by the ASD , any SPaT , TIM,  and MAP messages from any  RSU it 
can hear,  and the vehicle maneuver as a result of that warning. As the vehicle returns to its fleet 
terminal, the recorded data will be uploaded to the RSU at the terminal.   
 When the vehicle operator begins normal duties by turning on the ASD -equipped vehicle, the ASD will 
confirm whether it is ready for operation. If the ASD experiences a fault, it will generate a maintenance 
& operation (M&O) log data that contains the start -up event and the fault. When the vehicle returns to 
its fleet barn after normal operating hours, the ASD will communicate with the RSU to verify its 
firmware version against the advertised available version. If the ASD's version is outdated, then it will 
initiate the over -the-air (OTA) software and firmware update transaction from the RSU at t he vehicle's 
fleet barn.  
 
As the driver returns the vehicle to its respective fleet barn, the event data log will be transmitted from 
the ASD to the RSU at the barn. Then, the RSU will receive the data, acknowledge the transaction, 
and send it to NYCDOT TMC’s back office CV data processing center. The event log data will be 
processed for analyzing the safety benefits of the NYC CVPD. Then, it will undergo extensive post -
processing and normalization (i.e., cleansing) before being transmitted to the USDOT. As  it is 
aggregated, the types of event counts will be incremented by time -of-day, location, and event type into 
collection bins. Any traceable and private information will be discarded.  Once all errors are addressed 
and checked, the raw data will be purged. This independent evaluator (IE) log data will be used by the 
USDOT IE for additional evaluation and uploading onto its Research Data Exchange (RDE) portal.  
2.3.1.2  Parameter Management  
During installation, the ASD will be programmed with control parameters for tuning the safety applications to the NYC traffic environment. The software parameters will be uploaded via DSRC 
channels 174 and 176. Configuration parameters will also be downloaded to the ASD to determine 
minimum thresholds for each appli cation prior to the operation. For example, the vehicle kinematics 
including but not limited to center of gravity, speed, and curve radius will be set before the ASD is 
deployed in the field. Also, recording parameters will be set to establish threat arbit ration. This will 
prevent multiple safety applications from warning the driver and prioritize which application trigger will be activated before others.

U.S. Department of Transportation  
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |30 2.3.2  Event Recording Context  
The ASDs will log relevant information surrounding a  triggered event  as shown i n Figure 2-4. The 
trigger will be configurable and will include the CV application warnings, acceleration criteria, brake 
system status, etc. The time periods for col lecting data before and after the trigger event will be 
configurable for each event trigger.  These periods will consist of a few seconds (e.g., 10- 20) prior to 
and a few seconds (e.g., 30 -40) following the trigger’s activation .  The relevant information ( data) will 
be limited to what the ASD provides, and it may include vehicle data when the ASD is connect ed to 
the vehicle’s data bus (i.e., CAN, J1939) . For instance, each event log entry will include location ( i.e., 
latitude, longitude, elevation, 3 -axis a cceleration), indicated warnings, and the action ( i.e., lights, 
wipers, turn signals, steering angles, brakes) of the vehicle.  More importantly, this event log will be 
stored on the vehicle for later retrieval when the vehicle returns to its fleet termina l where the data will 
be offloaded.  
 Note that the definition of an event will be configurable so it can be used to collect short -term driver 
behavioral data (hard break, steering turns, accelerations, etc.) for aggregation and performance 
measures .  Howev er, such data will be cleansed of any traceable personal  data (exact location and 
time) to prevent from being correlated to other records such as police reports . 
2.3.3  CV Application Terminology  
Figure 2-5 outlines the classification of all applications to be deployed in the NYC CVPD system. As 
the ASDs communicate with other ASDs and RSUs, they will send and receive DSRC safety messages throug h multiple safety applications. These consist of V2V, Vehicle Performance Radio 
Frequency (RF) Monitoring, V2I, and I 2P applications. The ASDs will also utilize a set of management 
applications that support the communication and data management functions o f the system. Event 
management applications will record, upload, and forward the event records at the ASD, RSU, and TMC. Configuration management applications will upload and download the parameters and over -the-
air (OTA) firmware to and from the DSRC devi ces. System management applications will monitor the 
RF levels of the ASDs and RSUs and maintain the NYC CVPD system performance. Sensor application via the I -SIGCVDATA will utilize vehicle traffic sensors to provide CV data feeds to NYC's 
existing adaptiv e signal control system.

Six of the CV applications are intended to be utilized unchanged from their initial concept of 
operations.  These applications are listed in the SAE J2794/1 standard for V2V communications and 
the USDOT’s publication FHWA -JPO-13-058.  These applications do not need to be re -engineered as 
components of this project as this work has already been completed.  The applications and references for th em are listed in Table 2-6 below.

2.3.3.1.2  Vehicle Applications  
The Vehi cle Performance RF Monitoring (VPRFM) application will collect and log the vehicle 
operational data (i.e. hard breaking, steering wheel turns, acceleration).  
 
2.3.3.1.3  V2I Safety Applications  
Speed Compliance (SPDCOMP) application will provide warnings to drivers when they exceed the posted regulatory speed limit. If the vehicle is approaching a curve, the Curve Speed Compliance 
(CSPD -COMP) application will activate and warn the driver. Similarly, if the vehicle is approaching a 
designated work or school zo ne, the Speed Compliance in Work Zone (SPDCOMPWZ) application 
will be triggered.  
 
Red Light Violation Warning (RLVW) application will warn drivers when the ASD determines that they 
will run the red light. It will utilize the SPaT message from the RSU at th e signalized intersection.  
 
Oversize Vehicle Compliance (OVC) application will warn the driver of impending height -restricted 
infrastructure such as bridge or tunnel entrance. Each vehicle's size information will be configured into its ASD. Using the pre- configured vehicle height information, the ASD will determine whether the 
vehicle is able to pass through the bridge or tunnel.  
 
Emergency Communications and Evacuation Information (EVAC) application will support NYC's 
emergency communications and dissemina tion of evacuation traveler information. Centers including

Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |34 the Traffic Management Center (TMC), Office of Emergency Response (OER), and weather service 
will partake in the emergency operations and management functions.  
 
Pedestrian in Signalized Crosswalk ( PEDINXWALK) application will utilize the pedestrian detection 
information to warn drivers about the  presence of pedestrians in a crosswalk at a signalized 
intersection. As a pedestrian passes through a crosswalk at a signalized intersection with additional pedestrian detection equipment installed, the pedestrian’s presence will be detected by the traffi c 
control system. The traffic control system will notify the vehicle of a pedestrian’s presence in the crosswalk.  
 
Mobile Accessible Pedestrian Signal System (PED -SIG) application will support the visually impaired 
(blind) crossing the street. The NYC CVPD  project assumes that a portable personal information 
device (PID) such as a smartphone with both normal cellular and DSRC communication will be used. 
The traffic signal controller will communicate with the RSU at the same intersection which will transmit 
SPaT and MAP messages to the PID in a similar way to the ASD.  
2.3.3.2  Management Applications  
2.3.3.2.1  Event Management  
The Vehicle Event Management applications include Event Recording (EVTRECORD) and Event 
Uploading (EVTUPLD). As the ASD receives BSMs, the EVTRECORD appl ication will collect event 
logs before and after the warnings. Then, the EVTUPLD application will transmit the event record data to designated RSUs as the vehicle passed by them.  
 
The RSU Event Management application is Event Forwarding (EVTFRWD). As the R SU collects the 
event record data from the ASDs, it will send the data to the TMC's back -office CV data processing 
center.  
 
The TMC Event Management application is Event Collection (EVTCOLLECT). As the TMC's CV back -
office receives the event record data, i t will post -process and obfuscate the data to eliminate 
personally identifiable information (PII) and time and location breadcrumb information.  
 
2.3.3.2.2  Configuration Management  
The DSRC Device Configuration Management applications consist of Parameter Upload 
(PAR MUPLD), Parameter Download (PARMDNLD), and Over -the-Air Firmware Upload 
(OTAFRMWUPLD). The PARMUPLD and PARMDNLD applications will be used to install the 
necessary parameters to the ASD for each application before deployment. The OTAFRMWUPLD will 
be used f or remote firmware upgrades from the RSU at each fleet barn to the ASDs.  
 
The TMC Device Configuration Management applications are Parameter Get (PARMGET), Parameter 
Set (PARMSET), and Firmware Service (FRMWSRC). The PARMGET and PARMSET applications 
will b e used to transmit the parameter configurations from the TMC to the RSUs for installing into the 
ASDs. The FRMWSRC application will be used to provide the RSU at each fleet barn with the necessary firmware updates for uploading into the individual ASDs.  
 
2.3.3.2.3  System Management  
The Vehicle and RSU System Maintenance Management applications are the ASD RF Monitoring 
(ASDRFMTR) and RSU RF Monitoring (RSURFMTR). The ASDRFMTR application will be used to

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |35 detect the presence or absence of ASDs in the NYC CVPD. It will trace the radio frequency (RF) 
radiation issues to a specific vehicle, and the information collected will be given to the fleet owners for 
arranging repairs or adjustments to be made to the vehicle. The RSURFMTR application will address 
any temporary occlusion by a vehicle from issues such as vehicle ID change and the vehicle operator 
stopping or turning off the ASDs.  
 
The TMC System Maintenance Management applications are the ASD RF Get (ASDRFGET) and 
RSU RF Get (RSURFGET). Both applications will be used to post -process and analyze the RF logs 
from the ASDRFMTR and RSURFMTR applications. Similar to the EVTCOLLECT applic ation, the 
ASDRFGET and RSURFGET applications will purge the raw data of any PIIs and time and location 
information.  
2.3.3.3  Sensor Applications  
The TMC Vehicle Traffic Sensor application will be Intelligent Signal System CV Data (I -SIGCVDAT). It 
will utilize the NYC CVPD data as an input to NYC's existing Adaptive Control Decision Support 
System (ACDSS). This data will augment or replace the existing data from the toll tag reader system 
that provides travel time and speed information. This is intended  to compare t he two datasets and 
determine if ACDSS can rely on only the CV data collected  from the pilot deployment project . 
2.3.4  PID Context  
At first, the intent of the project was to use the localized Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) and Map Data (MAP) messages broadcast o ver Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) to provide 
assistance for visually impaired pedestrians while navigating the crosswalks at connected vehicle 
(CV) instrumented intersections.  It was recognized that this was experimental and would be a pilot 
trial of the use of the technology for this application.  When DSRC enabled smartphones were no 
longer available, per the vendor’s suggestion  the project scope was modified to use cellular 
communications (4G, LTE) to the smartphone instead of the DSRC medi a from the local Roadside 
Unit (RSU).  Since the SPaT information includes “time points”, the latencies involved in providing the 
SPaT information via cellular service for this type of application were expected to have minimal effect 
on the performance of the application.   
 Figure 2-6 displays the architecture of the PED -SIG or PED  application. The advanced solid -state 
traffic controllers (ASTC) were modified to trans mit SPaT information to the Traffic Management 
Center (TMC) for processing in preparation for use by the PID applications.  This data is transmitted to the TMC from the ASTC “on change” , such as when the values in the SPaT message changed.  At the 
TMC, the  information is time corrected to use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than Line 
Frequency Time and sent to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud along with the MAP message 
content which is stored at the TMC.  Thus, the AWS cloud is provided with the same data as the RSU 
so that the application can process this information and provide it to the PID to support intersection 
navigation assistance for a visually -impaired pedestrian.

Figure 2-6.  Pedestrian Support Application Architecture  
 
The MAP message contents were developed using the USDOT “tool”, updated with the sidewalk 
descriptions and augmented with the use of the Cyclomedia high resolution database to improve the 
accuracy of the location information for the crosswalks and landing zones.  It should also be noted that 
the MAP message used by the PIDs is not size constrained in the same manner as the MAP message transmitted by the RSU such that the TMC sends more detailed information to the AWS 
cloud than is transmitted by the RSU.  T he TMC exports the MAP and SPaT information to the AWS 
cloud where it is used by the PED application as described in their design specification.  
 
In addition, the vendor developed a “Location Augmentation Device” for use by the visually -impaired 
pedestria n to improve the overall accuracy of the location information when coupled with the 
smartphone to support the SC application.  The location accuracy of a smartphone in the urban 
environment is inadequate for such applications.  The Location Augmentation Device (LAD) is coupled 
to the smartphone using Bluetooth and the SC application uses both the smartphone location and 
compass coupled with the location information from the augmentation device to provide the 
assistance to the visually impaired pedestrian.   
 
When the SC application is active, evaluation data is supposed to be collected and sent to New York 
University (NYU) servers where it will be used for the performance evaluation for the PID program.  If 
the operation of the prototypes is acceptable, the plan is for NYU to acquire the smartphones, solicit 
participants, obtain consent from the users, and then distribute the smartphones to those users.  The 
data collected along with survey information is to be evaluated to determine the overall utility, valu e, 
and issues associated with the PID and SC application for the user community.  The project team

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |37 worked with the NYU Independent Review Board (IRB) to ensure safety, and privacy of the 
participants.   
 
The subsequent requirements section assumes that the  MAP and SPaT messages are transmitted as 
described above.   The following assumptions are made in developing the pedestrian application 
requirements:  
• Enrollment will download the security credentials, if the application is connecting to the signal.  
• There w ill be no signal actuation.  
• The application will connect with the cloud.  
• There will be no personal data collected.  
• The mobile device will be  easily managed by visually -impaired users . 
• There will be data from the signal to the mobile device.  
2.4 Major System Conditions  
The CV system is expected to always be in operation.  Management provisions are made to monitor 
the operation of the system’s devices in order to identify failures and resolve them.  These fall into two 
areas – one for the infrastructure d evices and their communications links with the other being the 
vehicle resident ASDs.  
 Driver/operators need to be informed when vehicles start that their vehicle resident ASD is operating 
properly.  Failed ASDs will not prevent the safe operation of the v ehicle by the driver/operator – the 
driver will not receive alerts/alarms from the device in when it is failed.  Support personnel will have to 
be notified by the driver/operator in order to begin the repair process.  
 
When  RSUs fail, vehicle drivers/operat ors will not be notified and will operate their vehicles normally 
without alerts/alarms from the ASDs for V2I applications.  In this state, the V2V applications will 
continue to function and provide alerts/alarms when in the presence of other connected vehicles 
(assuming that their ASDs are also functioning properly).  
 
Such fail conditions in the CV devices will result in safety -related implications such as inability to issue 
alerts. Furthermore, this will lead to insufficient or inaccurate data and safety benefit analysis of the 
system. The types of potential fail modes are defined in Table F-2 in the Appendix . 
2.5  Major System Constraints  
In New York City  (NYC), the speed limit is 25 mph unless signed otherwise.  This speed restriction has 
been recently implemented under the objectives of the Vision Zero program.  In New York City, turns on red signals are treated differently than the remainder of the nati on.  Right -turn-on-red (RTOR) after 
stop is prohibited within New York City unless signed to indicate otherwise.  This operational restriction has existed since the traffic laws were modified during the 1970s in response to fuel shortages.  NYC  
has unique definitions for commercial vehicles and trucks that differ from New York State Department 
of Motor Vehicles classifications.   It encourages drivers to check their vehicle’s classification 
information before making trips and to review the City’s truck route map to avoid problematic issues 
such as driving on the area’s parkways.  
Chapter 2. General System Description  
U.S. Department of Transportation  
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |38  
From the beginning of the CV program, ensuring individual privacy has been a key to adoption of the 
CV technology.  In order to produce these safety benefits consistent with the goals of the USDOT’s 
connected vehicle program, the project will adopt the USD OT objective to “not collect or store any 
data on individuals or individual vehicles, or will it enable the government to do so37.” Throughout all 
meetings with the project stakeholders, the stakeholders expressed that this objective must be met to 
continue their participation.  
 
The stakeholder’s concern is that time and location information constitutes potentially Personally 
Identifiable Information (PII) because it could be merged with other records ( e.g., police crash reports) 
and used in legal proceedings, disciplinary proceedin gs, or insurance negotiations.  Keeping data with 
this time/location information is a potential infringement of an individual’s privacy.  Concerns have also 
been expressed by the labor unions and legal departments that if such rec ords were known to exist, 
they would be subpoenaed for criminal and/or civil suits and would be subject to FOIA requests –  
which are very frequent in NYC.  
 
The goal of privacy poses a formidable challenge for the deployment of the NYC CVPD project.  While privacy is a fundamental concept embedded in the CV system design, the need to measure 
deployment benefits necessitates knowing details regarding the vehicle and its whereabouts.  To 
balance these competing objectives, the NYC CVPD will provide detailed vehicle operational 
information after it has been aggregated and normalized (i.e., scrubbed) of time and location details.  
This approach satisfies the detailed information needs for evaluation while protecting the privacy of the vehicle drivers/operators.  
 Another constraint is a result of the project’s focus on safety.  The NYC legal staff is concerned about 
the deployment of safety focused applications that may not provide warnings to the drivers/operators.  
On one hand, the concern is about a warning not being given to the driver/operator that could have 
mitigated a crash/injury/fatality situation. This also applies to participants who are visually -impaired or 
audibly -impaired. In addition to maintaining safety during the system operation, the memorandum of 
understanding (MOU), financial, and legal/regulatory terms and conditions will be established to 
protect the safety of all participants in the NYC CVPD.  
 
The other concern is that for the purposes of data collection for a before/after evaluation, the sys tem 
will operate in silent mode for a time period in order to gather data.  While the previous concern exists during this silent period, there is another regarding toggling the system between silent and active 
mode.  This mode difference has the potential to impact drivers’ decisions should they become secure 
in knowing the system will generate warnings when in fact it is in silent mode.  To address these concerns, the NYC project team proposes using a single transition from silent to active mode for the 
fleets. 
2.6 User Characteristics  
This section defines the users and stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities of the NYC CVPD system. The expected users represent various maintenance and operational functions, location, and 
type of utilized CV devices. The users are classified based on their perception of the system and the 
needs to be satisfied by the system.  Also, some of the key personnel may serve in multiple roles 
based on the user needs and functions.

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |39 2.6.1  Traffic Manager  
As the roadway infrast ructure owner, NYCDOT consists of multiple traffic managers in the NYC CVPD 
system. In supporting the goals of Vision Zero, the traffic managers' responsibilities include managing 
the speed on surface streets to 25 mph regulatory speed limit; reducing cras hes between vehicles, 
vehicles and infrastructure, vehicles and pedestrians, and vehicles and visually/audibly -impaired 
pedestrians; informing drivers of serious incidents; and providing mobility information in heavily 
congested areas.  
2.6.1.1  NYCDOT ASD Monitorin g Personnel  
The NYCDOT ASD monitoring personnel is responsible for checking the health status and RF footprint of the communication to and from ASDs in the NYC CVPD. The ASD will collect log 
information on its operational status and sent for review. When e quipment faults are detected, the 
monitoring personnel will notify and dispatch the maintenance personnel to the vehicle fleet barn, where troubleshooting and repair works will be performed.  
2.6.1.2  NYCDOT RSU Monitoring  Personnel  
The NYCDOT RSU monitoring personn el is responsible for checking the health status and RF 
footprint of the communication to and from RSUs in the NYC CVPD. When equipment failures are 
detected, they will notify and dispatch the maintenance personnel to the RSU. The proposed RSU 
locations co nsist of signalized intersection, vehicle fleet terminal, bridge/tunnel crossings, and other 
designated locations that may be outside the NYC CVPD pilot area.  
2.6.1.3  NYCDOT TMC Operators  
The NYCDOT Traffic Management Center (TMC) operators are responsible for operating the citywide 
TMC.  They interact with the traffic control system (TCS) and provide operator data and command 
inputs to the system operations. Status on field equipment such as wired and wireless communication 
networks and traffic signal controller (A STC) upgrades will be communicated with other NYC CV 
system users.  
 The TMC operators will also communicate with the  RSUs in the NYC CVPD to monitor and manage 
traffic flow and roadway conditions. For minor traffic accidents and work zone activities, they will work 
with the City's traffic surveillance system, traffic information system, work zone management system 
to monitor traffic in and around the areas of influence. In the event of major disasters, they will 
coordinate incident management activities and  exchange information with NYCDOT Office of 
Emergency Response (OER).  
2.6.2  Fleet Manager  
In the NYC CVPD, the fleet manager will be responsible for overseeing the vehicle equipment installation, coordinating maintenance activities, and daily operation of the vehicles. Their roles include 
managing equipment maintenance, and daily operations of the vehicle fleets. Also, their major concern on potential use of the data for enforcement or driver performance assessment will be addressed by establishing the need to have privacy of vehicles and drivers in the CV system.

Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |40 2.6.2.1  NYCDOT  Fleets  
NYCDOT Fleets represent the fleet owners that manage maintenance vehicles, trucks, and 
passenger cars from NYCDOT for its daily operation. They  include light-duty and heavy  vehicles such 
as inspector’s cars, passenger trucks, asphalt trucks, and other construction vehicles. Approximately 
1230  NYCDOT vehicles are expected to be deployed in the NYC CVPD program.  
 
2.6.2.2  Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS)  
DCAS in NYC is the agency  that provides shared services to support City operations. I t administers 
citywide fleet management including maintenance and operation of motor vehicle pool . Due to 
TLC/taxi fleet s, UPS, and DSNY no longer deciding to participate in NYC CVPD, NYCDOT has been 
able to coordinate with DCAS fleet owners in obtaining additional vehicles for ASD installation and 
deployment. About 1759 DCAS fleet vehicles are expected to be deployed in the NYC CVPD 
program.  
2.6.2.3  Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)  
MTA is the a gency responsible for operation and maintenance of local and express buses in NYC's 
five boroughs. It manages about a total of 5, 900 buses that belong to ~16  different bus models. In the 
NYC CVPD project, eleven (11)  buses have been deployed.  
2.6.3  Roadway Users  
The roadway users in the NYC CVPD include vehicle drivers/operators, pedestrians, and performance 
management users. Based on stakeholder meetings with the participating fleet owners, the need for privacy and management of the CV applications for the traff ic environment will apply to both fleet 
owners and roadway users.  
2.6.3.1  Drivers  
Drivers represent the vehicle operators from each participating fleet owner in the NYC CVPD. With the 
project plan to instrument 3 ,000 vehicles, the project will be dealing with a potentially much larger pool 
of driver/operators. This is due to the nature of the fleets and that multiple drivers may be used to 
operate the  vehicles. Many of the fleet vehicles will be in service more than five days a week and for 
periods we ll beyond an e ight (8)-hour shift. If the ASD in the vehicle experiences a fault, the driver will 
be responsible for reporting to the fleet owner who will then notify the NYCDOT and coordinate 
maintenance activities.  
 
Vehicle driver/operators will also be  responsible for identifying issues with their vehicles and bringing 
those issues to the attention of the vehicle owners for repair.  In the case of the vehicle fleets, some fleet owners have internal organizations for vehicle maintenance.  Other fleet own ers utilize third -party 
maintenance providers for vehicle maintenance on a contract basis.  
2.6.3.2  Pedestrians  
Pedestrians represent the peop le that walk along the roadways. In the NYC CVPD system, t hey are 
classified into  two distinct groups . The first group includes the visual impaired  pedestrians who are 
participating in the NYC CV pilot and equipped with personal information devices (PID) . Each

U.S. Department of Transportation  
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |41 participant will carry the PID which will be used for the Mobile Accessible Pedestrian Signal Sy stem 
(PED -SIG) application in assisting the visually -impaired pedestrian to cross the intersection safely.  
Pedestrians for Accessible and Safe Streets (PASS) is the coalition that works to promote safe access 
to sidewalks and streets for the visually -impaired and audibly -impaired pedestrians in NYC.  PASS is 
expected to be a stakeholder that will aid in recruiting the visually -impaired pedestrians for the NYC 
CV pilot.  
 
The second group consists of pedestrians who are not participants  and not carrying any PIDs.  They 
may be crossing intersections that are proposed to be equipped with new pedestrian detection equipment. These intersections are listed in see Table 35 in NYC CVPD Phase 1 ConOps, FHWA -
JPO-16-299. This pedestrian detection data will be used for the Pedestrian in Signalized Crosswalk 
(PEDINXWALK) application and alerting the driver of the pedestrian crossing.  
 
2.6.3.3  Performance Measurement Users 
Performance measurement users will be responsible for viewing the daily event log history, the log 
uploading process, and batch processing of the data. They will be able to see and understand how 
much data and how many events are generated and recorded. Also, they will be the first point people for noticing any anomalies in the CV device operation, such as errors  in time synchronization in the 
ASDs via Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) devices.  
2.6.4  System Manager  
The system manager in NYC CVPD will be responsible for the roadway and traffic control devices in 
the project areas.  It uses internal and external t hird-party resources to maintain the roadway 
infrastructure.  There are well established relationships and procedures within the NYCDOT for these maintenance activities.  These processes include reporting facilities (e.g. 511, web sites), work order 
generation and tracking, and management oversight.  
 
NYCDOT and Do ITT share responsibility for communications infrastructure.  Both organizations utilize 
a combination of internal staff as well as third- party contractors to maintain this equipment.  The lines 
of demar cation between the organizations and their responsibilities are well -known and managed 
through existing systems and processes.  
2.6.4.1  NYC Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications (DoITT)  
As NYC's communication infrastructure owner/operator, the NYC DoITT will be responsible for the 
back-office environment through NYCWiN. It will also work with NYCDOT in resolving compatibility 
issues with NYCWiN's existing IPv4 network backhaul with NYC CVPD system's IPv6 infrastructure. In conjunction with N YCDOT, NYC DoITT will m aintain  the security and reli ability of NYC's 
communications infrastructure for the NYC CVPD system operation.  
 
2.6.4.2  NYCDOT Traffic Management Center (TMC) Back Office  
The back -office in the NYCDOT TMC will provide the following managemen t functions:  
• Managing RSU performance (failure identification, repair, maintenance)  
• Managing RSU radio frequency  (RF) footprints  
Chapter 2. General System Description  
U.S. Department of Transportation  
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |42 • Managing CV application configuration 
• Distributing obfuscated data e xternal ly to USDOT  Independent Evaluator (IE)  
• Collecting data from  the RSU/ASD  
• Aggregati ng, normaliz ing, and obfuscating the CV data 
• Assessing the NYC CVPD system performance and safety benefits  
 
The support environment for the CV system's core services will includ e the following elements:  
• USDOT Production Security  Credentials Management System ( SCMS ) 
• Operational Data Environment  (ODE ) 
• Object Registration and Discovery Service (ORDS)  
• Location and Time Source (LTS)  
• Service Monitor System (SMS)  
• Wide Area Information Disseminator (WAID)  
 
The Security  Credential Management System (SCMS), Operational Data Environment (ODE), and 
Object Registration Discovery Service (ORDS) are expected to be developed and provided by the USDOT.  The ODE has replaced the Data Distribution System (DDS) as the platform for routing the 
data from multiple data sources to a common, integrated format for subscribers to software 
applications such as CV applications.  The Location and Time Source (LTS), Service Monitor (SM) 
System, and Wide Area Information Disseminator (WAID) wil l be provided by NYCDOT as the owner 
of the NYC CVPD system.  
 The back office facilities at NYCDOT Traffic Management Center (TMC) will not be used for the 
security credentials management system (SCMS) functions, security enrollment certificates signing, 
and DSRC messages (BSM, SPaT, MAP, TIM) signing.  Instead, these operations will be allocated to 
the field RSUs as supported by the latest USDOT RSU specification.  Another option for consideration 
entailed utilizing a separate RSU within the TMC in lieu of  the back office proxy server for managing 
the SCMS and signing of the enrollment certificates, pseudonym certificates, and safety messages transmitted by the devices.  However, the method of allowing individual RSUs to sign the data has 
been selected to m itigate risks on schedule and cost.  
 
2.6.4.3  NYCDOT Maintenance  Personnel  
The NYCDOT maintenance personnel will be responsible for troubleshooting and repairing faults in 
the CV equipment software and hardware. The RSUs' operation will be checked for issues by the 
NYCDOT monitoring personnel who will determine whether site visits and field repairs will be required. 
Once the issues are diagnosed, the maintenance technicians will be dispatched to the RSU locations, 
perform the repairs, and report back to the monit oring staff.  
 
The maintenance technician will also monitor the RF footprint of the communication to and from the 
device. When new firmware version becomes available, the technician will makes sure the firmware 
update is transmitted from the RSU and install ed in the ASD. Also, the CV application configurations 
will be downloaded and tweaked as needed from the vehicle's OBD II/CAN bus port.  
 
Chapter 2. General System Description  
U.S. Department of Transportation  
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology  
Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office  
CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |43 For software and firmware updates, the NYCDOT maintenance staff will work with the TMC to install 
them via the  RSU at each vehicle fleet barn. Once the vehicle returns to its garage after normal 
operation, the  RSU will communicate with the ASD to check its firmware version. When an upgrade is 
needed, the ASD will request the over -the-air (OTA) firmware upgrade package whic h will be installed 
via the RSU. 
2.6.4.4  Performance Measurement Manager  
Performance measurement managers will be responsible for checking and validating the daily event 
log history, the log uploading process, and batch processing of the data. They will be able to  
determine how much data and how many events are generated and recorded. Also, they will receive the data transmitted from the ASDs and the RSUs and run batch processing to scrub them of any 
personally identifiable information (PII) including but not limit ed to time and location.  
 
For establishing and quantifying the NYC performance targets, the NYC performance measurement 
managers will utilize field observed data and traffic microsimulation software such as Aimsun to model 
and estimate traffic operations.   This allows the calculation of performance metrics from both field data 
where possible and also from simulated operations of vehicles where that collection of field data is not 
possible or exceedingly difficult or expensive.  
2.6.5  Independent Evaluator  
Performa nce measurement users will be responsible for viewing the daily event log history, the log 
uploading process, and batch processing of the data. They will be able to see and understand how 
much data and how many events are generated and recorded. Also, they  will be the first point people 
for noticing any anomalies in the CV device operation, such as errors in time synchronization in the ASDs via Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) devices.  
2.6.5.1  NYCDOT IRB  
NYU will be the IRB and perform the initial assessment of the vehicle and pedestrian data and the 
ensuing safety benefits. The CV application performance will also be analyzed in consideration of the 
dense urban environment where intersections are tightly clustered together (e.g. ~250 feet) and 
location referencing will be  a technical challenge due to the “ urban canyon effect” from  tall buildings 
and limited views of the GNSS devices.  
2.6.5.2  USDOT IE  
The USDOT will engage Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) as the independent evaluator (IE) to 
analyze the project’s performance with respect to USDOT's goals that may or may not include goals 
identified by the NYC pilot site. TTI will be responsible for analyzing the processed event data and the 
safety benefits of the NYC CVPD program. In addition to the safet y benefits, the USDOT is interested 
in exploring what additional benefits such as mobility, environmental, and public agency efficiency are attained with the NYC CVPD. To measure the CV application’s benefits, the project will incorporate a 
before/after ev aluation using the CV equipment installed in fleet vehicles.  The ASD equipment will be 
used to collect information regarding the performance of the CV applications in the project’s 
geographic and traffic environment.

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |44 2.7  Assumptions and D ependencies  
The fund amental message of the NYC Vision Zero initiative is that death and injury on city streets is 
not acceptable. These tragedies happen in every community within NYC, to families from every walk 
of life –  from the Upper East Side to the Lower East Side; from Park Slope to Edenwald. They happen 
to people who drive and to those who bike;  but overwhelmingly, the deadly toll is highest for 
pedestrians – especially children and seniors. The goal of Vision Zero is to eliminate traffic deaths by 
2024.   The NYC CV Pil ot Deployment project will focus on safety improvements for both motorists and 
non-motorists. In particular, the crash risks increase during nighttime hours when vehicle speeds tend 
to be higher and it becomes more difficult for vehicle drivers to see pede strians crossing the roadway.  
 
As the safety statistics indicate, surface improvements on city streets alone will not mitigate the 
number of crashes, fatalities, and severe injuries long -term. While no Silver Bullet will end all crashes, 
multiple supplemental tools are needed that can work together to attain Vision Zero’s goal. The CV 
technology is one of these tools and it presents a systematic approach in alerting vehicles of unsafe 
roadway conditions and prevents collisions with other vehicles, pedestri ans, and bicyclists. It will 
provide numerous safety benefits that facilitate Vision Zero's goals and initiatives.  
 
The following  assumptions represent a risk to the project that will affect the ability to meet the 
schedule or performance goals.  
(a.) The Security Credential Management System  version 1.1 will need to be available and stable 
by November 1, 2016.  USDOT will need to define the specific protocols for all users to 
incorporate and the certification processes required to ensure equipment meets the 
standards for security and interoperability.   
The protocols and their implementation will need to be able to handle messages at the rate 
needed for the traffic density in New York City.  The response times for the SCMS will have an 
impact on the system design as to whether credentials need to be managed as store and 
forward due to the demands for service.  Note that this is an importan t consideration based 
on the future of the use of the SCMS.   
This is a deployment with actual users in revenue service; the security must be in place 
before testing moves to drivers outside the project team.  
(b.) How well the DSRC and GNSS will perform in the urban canyon.  The team already knows 
some of the issues from prior projects and preliminary testing.  The early acquisition of ASDs 
will enable continued testing and development throughout Phase 2.  
It is also clear that the location “tracking” mechanism needs to continue in an active mode in 
the urban environment where possible –  or many of the freeway applications will be turned 
off.  There are large areas of NYC where there is “something” overhead –  it is unfortunate that 
every time GPS is lost, they al l become inactive?  
(c.) The Schedule will be met by the selected vendors.  The demands on the hardware and the 
complexity of the software will be unprecedented for connected vehicle equipment.  The team 
will work with vendors to establish realistic schedules an d enable as much work in parallel as 
possible.  After development is complete, manufacturing and installing the units will take time.  
(d.) The contracting delays and schedule will require that the vendors start much of their work “at 
risk”; if the city takes 6 months after announcement of award, the vendors will need to

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) - New York City - Final |45 proceed with the development and hardware design “at risk” in order to even come close to 
meeting the proposed schedule.  That is – much of the development, certification, and testing 
must, of necessity, begin before the City issues a billable contract. It is also likely that the prototypes will be delivered and installed before the contract is issued! Will all of the vendors 
accept such conditions?   
(e.) Review & approval by USDOT of all aspects of t he Phase 2 work must be done very quickly 
and the existing “approvals” of the ConOps, requirements, performance evaluations, SMOC 
must be used to jump start the development and procurement specifications.   
(f.) Data collection in the “Before” period begins May  2018 at the start of Phase 3.  
(g.) There is inadequate time [schedule] and budget to deal with a vendor pre -qualification phase 
and bake -off.  We will rely on the responses to the RFEI; the vendor chosen may not be the 
low bid as we will require further demons trations prior to award.  However, once the vendors 
have been chosen, the project is at significant risk until the completion of the 100 ASD/10 RSU pre -pilot installation and testing program is successfully completed; if the vendor is 
ultimately unable to complete this phase successfully, the schedule is at serious risk because of the time required to start with an additional vendor.  If we move forward with 2 vendors, the 
risk is mitigated, but the development costs and integration costs may as much as dou ble. 
(h.) USDOT completes its promised tools and utilities – especially for the development of the 
MAP message (including PED crossings) by the end of 2016.   
(i.) The FCC does not change the use patterns for the DSRC band – as this could necessitate a 
re-design and re-engineering of both the hardware and software.

(Clarification: the monitoring system [internal to the ASD] shall confirm that the actual audio information [sound] was pro duced in the vehicle and that the audio information 
matches what the alert was intended to deliver.  The purpose of this requirement is detect faulty speaker wiring and damaged speakers that prevent the alert from being delivered to the driver.  It is not intended to be an accurate voice to text conversion 
system, but sufficient to determine that an alert message was delivered.)  
By way of example, a microphone located at or near the speaker can verify that the specific audio word(s) or tone was presented to  the driver; contrarily, simply measuring

As noted above, the ASD is responsible for notifying the driver when there is a threat that is detected 
by the ASD applications; such threats  include those posed by the V2V applications as well as those 
described by the V2I applications.  The requirements listed below are based on t he concept of 
ongoing logging of situational status which is then collected and stored as an encrypted event record 
that will provide a snapshot of data collected before and after the “event” as outlined herein.  The 
event record is encrypted on the ASD and sent to the analysis server which is part of the NYC CVPD 
back office systems.  
 
ReqID  Requirement Text  
501.2.1 The ASD shall include a general purpose event recording application.  
501.2.1.1 The ASD shall include a rotating 5 minute log of the raw data listed in Table G -4.

ReqID  Requirement Text  
502.1.1 When the event recording receives a triggering input, it shall start the creation of an 
event record.  
502.1.2 Each event record shall indicate the application and the reason that the alarm was created; (Clarification: each triggering event (alarm) will notify the ASD logging system to initiate the creation of an event record a nd will provide some application specific

not specified at this time.  The RSU’s located in the ba rn and at choke points are 
intended to accomplish this upload process, although this could also be added to any or all of the RSU’s.)  
502.1.9 Event records shall be automatically purged whenever the power is applied to the ASD and the time last log entry is more than a configurable number of hours 
(example: 96 hours).  
(Clarification: all of the vehicles for the NYC CVPD are fleet vehicles and he nce 
normally return to their “barn” on a daily basis.  However, in some cases, if a fleet vehicle is driven “home” and not returned to a location where an RSU can access its 
logs, the project would like to recover that data when the vehicle returns to the City if 
possible without compromising privacy.)

101.2.11, 
101.3.11  Ahead See MUTCD Table 2C -4 
101.2.15  Curve alert distance (feet)  Distance required for a vehicle to decelerate from its current speed to the curve advisory speed at a deceleration rate [that is configurable by vehicle type], plus an allowance of <TBD> seconds for driver 
perception time (Note: this will be detailed in the design phase.)  
101.2.16  Warning Notification from the ASD to the driver once the ASD determines that the application threshold  has been 
exceeded and violation or crash is imminent.  
101.2.16  Alert Trigger  generated by the once the ASD determines that the application threshold has been exceeded. Once 
the alert is triggered, the ASD generates the corresponding warning to the driver . 
101.2.16  Time period Amount of time detected by the ASD in which the application threshold is exceeded by the vehicle 
101.2.6, 
102.6.7  Sufficiently accurate position  Road- level accuracy (which needs to be defined at the system level for use in other ap ps) 
101.2.6, 
102.6.7  Sufficiently accurate speed (mph)  Calculation of where to begin the alert use the lower end of the 90% confidence interval for speed. That way the app will issue an alert only if it is confident that one is warranted.  
101.2.6, 102.6.7  Sufficiently accurate heading  First, confidence of the direction of travel on the road (again, needs a system -level determination). Second, 
projected path includes an instrumented curve. Ordinarily, that will be clear to project. When an e xit is within 
range, we do not know whether the exit will be taken. So say that we know the heading only when the exit 
and the road have instrumented curves.  
101.3.11, 
401.14. 23  Advise, advisory  Initial notification from the ASD to the driver  once the AS D determines  that the application threshold will 
exceed and violation or crash is likely to occur.

 Table E-2 below lists the parameters needed by multiple safety applications.  All applications need a parameter that can be used to stop the application 
from providing alerts. For most applications, this can be the minimum speed where the application is active. If the minimum s peed for an application is set 
to 100 mph, the application is essentially disabled. The oversized vehicle compliance application d oes not have a minimum speed, but it can be disabled 
by broadcasting an expiration time for the Traveler Information Message  (TIM) it is based on. The Emergency Communications and Evacuation 
Information (EVAC) app operates via TIM messages as well, and is essentially always inactive unless an EVAC TIM message has been received.  
 All vehicle safety applications also have a recorded sound that plays to present the alert to the driver. Audible messages fo r the Emergency Evacuation 
application are transmitted as needed, so the ability to download a sound is required for this application. Using that ability to change the alert sounds for 
other applications during the testing period will provide flexibility to experiment with buzzers and phrases.  
A minimum confide nce level parameter will enable the applications to be adjusted for accuracy. Exactly how that works will depend on the 
implementation .

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) -  New York City -  Final |159 Vehicle -specific values, notably size, are encoded in the ASD when it is installed in the vehicle. Whether these shoul d be adjustable only with physical 
access to the vehicle is a question for discussion. Locating a vehicle known to have incorrect dimensions could be difficult.  On the other hand, 
dimensions are best confirmed when the vehicle is present.  
 
The vehicle- dependent maximum braking capability is a remotely tunable parameter needed by some applications.  The vehicles do not sense whether 
they are loaded, so the braking capability will assume the vehicle is loaded. None of the applications account for surface co nditions or other weather -
related conditions  
 To support the performance evaluation, engineering data will be recorded whenever an application is triggered. Event recording parameters are the pre-
trigger recording time and the post -trigger recording time, wh ich may vary by application. Additional event recording parameters, such as recording 
resolution (e.g., percentage of BSMs to be recorded), may also be desired.  
 
The top -level software on the ASD needs parameters to utilize threat arbitration and control s imultaneous or nearly simultaneous alerts from multiple 
applications. The priority among the alerts is most simply stored as an order, 1 -13, of the vehicle safety applications. There is also a minimum quiet time 
between two alerts, or alert spacing.  
 
Note that Table E-2 provides an initial list of the parameters in the NYC CVPD system. Therefore, each application includes a number of  free parameters 
to be considered for future decisions.

CV Pilot Deployment Program Phase 1, System Requirements Specification (SyRS) -  New York City |168 As-Built Addendum  
This section highlights changes made to the overall SyRS  due to the final deployment and the 
schedule of activity.  Elements within this section supersede portions of the document not altered to 
reflect the details of the changes.  
a. The PID application to assist the visually impaired pedestrian at CV equipped intersections has changed significantly.  The SPaT information is received from the ASTC, combined with the MAP 
information stored at the TMC and sent to the AWS cloud where the SmartCross application 
process the data and distributes it to the appropriate PID using a cellular service.  The data is then 
collected and exported to the NYU data collection system where it is evaluated.  Instead of 
distributing PIDs to the user communit y for testing/trials and evaluation, the 10 prototypes will be 
used with selected participants who will test/trial the PID application in a protected and assisted 
environment.  Evaluation of the preliminary results indicated that the application was not robust 
enough to be distributed without supervision in a protected environment.  The detailed design is 
provided in a separate document.  Section 2.3.4 and Figure 2 -6 have been updated accordingly.  
In addition, the PID will not be enrolled with the SCMS as previously described.  
b. Note that the communications between the TMC and the RSU uses 2 different protocols: SNMPv3 for management of the MIB objects supported by the RSU, and XFER a proprietary protocol developed by the RSU vendor for uploading and download ing files used for data 
collection, and RSU configuration.  It should be noted that NTCIP 1218 had not been developed at the time of this project, and it was necessary to utilize the vendor’s protocol to support these 
exchanges.  The vendor has made this protocol readily and publicly available without restriction 
for use with their RSUs.   
c. While there is some discussion of the use of UPS participation and the participation of the Taxi 
fleets/owners, both of these did not become active participants in the pr oject,  The fleet is primarily 
composed of various City fleets including DCAS, Parks, DOT, Department of Corrections (DOC), 
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Department of Health Services (DHS), and other 
service fleets operated by NYC.  The Ci ty fleets are generally equipped with Geotab devices 
which monitors their general usage; this data has been available to the CVPD project to 
determine the general routes and locations frequented by the City fleets participating in the CVPD 
project.  This d ata will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the data collected and to assist the 
project in monitoring the health of the CV equipped vehicles.   
d. The HSM is a rack -mountable appliance installed at the TMC to expand TMC operations with 
direct -to-vehicle mes saging over latest V2X network technology. Traveler Information, MAP, and 
other infrastructure messages are inspected and digitally signed to prevent hacking so TMC messages can be trusted. The HSM authenticates incoming messages and signs certificates for  
outgoing messages to and from the TMC. The HSM inspects and formats TMC messages for 
acceptance by V2X networked devices. Installed RSUs and ASDs do not require any additional 
components.  In addition to the NYCDOT TMC back -office management functions, the  HSM has 
been critical for maintaining the security of the data being transmitted.  A lso known as the TMC 
Authority, provides complete support for IEEE 1609.2 algorithms and protocols including SAE 
J2735, and J2945/x. It also provides FIPS 140- 2 Level 3 pr otection for V2X signing keys. The 
TMC Authority checks and digitally signs traffic management center messages for instant 
verification and acceptance, compliant with IEEE 1609.2 standards and cryptography. Data is

servers. High availability network failover is standard, including redundant power supplies and 
storage; the TMC Authority maintains trusted reliable operation, even in untrusted environments.  
e. Achieving location augmentation has been critical especially in the urban canyon parts of the NYC 
CV Pilot area. To  improve location accuracy for the DSRC devices in the NYC CV project, using 
the DSRC Radio Technical Commission for Maritime (RTCM) was considered fir st. As defined in 
SAE J2735, the RTCM messages would be transmitted along with the other DSRC messages 
over channel 172. However, the V2XLocate technology was chosen instead after multiple tests 
and demonstrations in the Manhattan grid section of the NYC C V pilot area.
