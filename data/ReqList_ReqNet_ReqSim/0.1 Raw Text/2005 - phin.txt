1 INTRODUCTION 
This document describes the Public Health  Infor mation Network (P HIN) functional 
requirem ents for systems im plem ented to part icipate in th e manage ment of outbreaks and 
other health events. Outbreak Managem ent (O M) is the P HIN functional area inte nded to 
support the needs of investiga tion, monitoring, m anage ment, analysis, and reporting of a 
health event or act of bioterro rism.  OM should aid in the colle ction and analysis  of data to 
support identifying and containing the health event.  OM system s should be configurable 
to m eet the needs of different types of health  events, and captur e data  rela ted to cases , 
contacts, investigations, exposures, rela tionships, clinical  and environm ental 
specim ens/samples, laboratory  resu lts, v accin ations and treatm ents, travel h istory, and 
conveyance inform ation.  The application should  also allow for new objects to be defined 
and created during the course  of an investigation. 
 
Central to the functionali ty of a system  supporting OM is th e ability to collect data related 
to cases and exposures and to create traceable  links between all appr opriate entities.  By 
tracing the m echanism  of transm ission and iden tifying the s ource of  the health ev ent, the  
appropriate response staff can more effectivel y contain the event.  System s supporting OM  
should also be integrated with the sy stem s supporting early event detection, 
counterm easure adm inistration, laboratory, and su rveillance to achieve the prim ary goal of  
managing the response to and m itigating th e effects of an event.     
 
This document provides m inimum operationa l requirem ents necessary to support an 
outbreak m anagem ent system  and should in no way preclude a system  from  incorporating 
additional functionality beyond what has been covered in this docum ent.

2 OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT FUNC TIONAL REQUI REMENTS  
The following requirements describe baseline f unctionality for any system (s) im plemented 
to support O utbreak Managem ent: 
2.1 System Architecture : Broad system -level needs, su ch as flexible conf iguration, 
should be addressed by system s supporting OM. 
2.2 Data Requiremen ts:  System s supporting O M need a variety of data to support 
investigations, incl uding data regarding dem ographics, cases, exposures, 
investigations, agents, contact s, specim en/sa mple collection, laboratory tests, travel 
and conveyance, and restriction m onitoring.  
2.3 System Functions and Behaviors :  System s supporting OM should support case 
investigatio n, maintain detailed and com prehensive linkages, trace contacts, and 
quarantine and isolation monitoring activ ities. 
2.4 Analysis, Visualization, and Report Generation :  Systems supporting OM should 
enable investigators to produce both aggregat ed and individual reports about affected 
entities and events. 
2.5 System Integration and Data Exchange :  OM inform ation m ust be 
exchangeable, based on established standa rds, between system s involved in the 
investigation, identification, confirmati on, and reporting of a health event. 
2.6 Vocabulary Standards: Standard vocabulary lists and data structures have been 
defined by standards organiza tions. Where they exist, system s supporting OM should 
use them .  As additional standard s are defined, th ey should be accepted an d 
implem ented  
2.7 Operations :  Personn el, ro les, activities, and responsibilities necessary  to support 
all aspects of OM should be clearly defined. 
2.8 System Security an d Availability : Secur ity of OM data in cludes the protection of 
data from  corruption and  access by u nauthorized  individu als, as well as th e protection 
of the actual system s supporting OM from  sabotage or other failure. A plan m ust be 
established f or continuing activities when system s supporting OM are unavailable. 
2.9 Privacy:  Patients, organizations, and personnel must be protected from fraudulent 
and unauthorized use of their information. 
2.1 SYST EM ARCHITE CTURE 
2.1.1 System s des igned to support OM must offer c onfiguration flexibility so that new 
data fields, entities, entity types and re lationship types m ay be added to capture 
inform ation unique to each particular health event. 
2.1.2 System s supporting OM m ust support struct ured data entry for common for ms and 
fields to ensure data integrity, validity, and standardization.  A standardized data 
struc ture ensures that data m apping of  common elem ents will only be  nece ssary on e 
time, rather than for each event. 
2.1.3 System s supporting O M should support m ultiple dep loyment options (e.g., client  
server, d isconnected, and  potentially web based). 
Revisio n Date: 4/28/2005  Page 4 of 1 6 
OM_RSv1.0 FINAL.doc 
Outb reak Management Functio nal Req uirements  Versio n: 1.0 
2.1.3.1  System s supporting OM should provide  the ability for com puters in 
disconnected m ode to reconnect to a server to share OM data am ong other 
computers that operate in disconnected m ode. 
2.1.3.2  OM data should be synchronized so that  all insta nces of  OM applic ation s 
working from the sam e server are ab le to sh are a nd use the s ame data. 
2.1.4 System s supporting OM should be able to el ectronically record and store data from 
remote devices that m ay be uploaded to an aggregating system. 
2.1.5 System s supporting OM should be capable of using configurable, dom ain-specific 
vocabulary.   
2.2 DATA REQUIREMENTS 
The following high-level da ta requ irements a re neces sary to ensure  that the data  being 
collected, analyzed, an d reported to  support OM are clearly defined. 
2.2.1 Entity  Data 
An entity is any being or object inv olved in a health event.  Entities ma y be classified as 
a person, o rganization,  location, a nimal, ob ject, conveya nce, event, or other or ganism.  
Each type of entity requ ires specific data to be collected. 
2.2.1.1  System s supporting OM must have the cap ability to capture dem ographic data 
about persons involved in an OM inves tigation, including:  S ubject ID, nam e, 
address, date of birth, gender, phone nu mber, race, ethnicity, and country of 
citizensh ip. 
2.2.1.1.a  Other descriptive details m ay be captured, such as occupation and 
work history.   
2.2.1.2  System s supporting OM must have th e capability to captu re data abou t 
organizations (e.g., a local health de partm ent, a university, a professional 
association) involved in an OM inve stigation, including: organization nam e, 
location, and contact inform ation. 
2.2.1.3  System s supporting OM must have th e capability to captu re data abou t 
locations involved in an OM investigati on, including:  nam e (if applicable), 
type (e.g., floor, building, room , store), st reet address, cit y, state, zip code, 
country, GPS coordinates, and other sp ecific details (e.g., a specific building 
on a cam pus, a business branch locati on, a local chapter’s m eeting hall) 
2.2.1.4  System s supporting OM must have the capability to captu re data abou t any 
anim als involved in an OM investigati on, including: type (dog, m onkey, etc), 
age, gender, owner’s nam e and address,  color, weight, and species. A Subject 
ID should also be collected for anim als in an OM investigation.  It m ay be a 
challenge to ensure unam biguous identification b ecause dem ographic d etails 
of an anim al are not easily identifi ed; therefore, anim als involved in 
investigations m ay need to be tagged.

OM_RSv1.0 FINAL.doc 
Outb reak Management Functio nal Req uirements  Versio n: 1.0 
2.2.1.5  System s supporting OM must have the capability to captu re data for any 
object involved in an OM investigation, su ch as a letter, invoice, food item, or 
any object that canno t be class ified as a “person, organization, place, or 
anim al.”  Collected data m ay include:  nam e of the object, type, physical 
descriptors, address, iden tification num ber (e.g. seri al num ber, package slip 
number), and relevant dates and tim es (e.g., invoice date, shipping date, 
packaging d ate). 
2.2.1.6  System s supporting OM must have the capability to captu re data abou t any 
conveyance involved in an OM investiga tion, including:  type of conveyance, 
route taken (e.g., flight num ber), etc.

public or private gathering of people (e.g., church social, ball gam e) involved 
in an OM investigation, including:  tim e, location, nature of the event, etc. 
2.2.1.8  System s supporting OM must have the capability to captu re data abou t any 
living things other than persons or anim als that are involved in an OM 
investigation, including: type of living thing, and other custom izable data 
collection questions.  
2.2.1.9  System s supporting OM must have the capab ility to captu re an entity’s tra vel 
history to support investigations of en tities infected, expos ed or potentially 
exposed.   
2.2.2 Health Event Data 
2.2.2.1  When a health event is investig ated, it must be as signed an ev ent iden tifier 
(i.e., Event ID) that is uni que within the jurisdiction. 
2.2.2.2  Data describing the health event should  be captured, includ ing the reason for 
the investigation, th e category of event (e.g. enviro nmental, infectious), the 
date the event began, the suspected agen t (if known) or investigation focus, 
the geograp hic area im pacted by the event,  as well as the event status (e.g., 
open, closed). 
2.2.2.3  System s supporting OM should have the ab ility to record the case definition 
for a health event. 
2.2.2.4  System s supporting OM should have the ab ility to capture changes to the case 
definition th at occu r as the health ev ent evolv es. 
2.2.3 Travel Histor y and Conveyan ce Data 
Travel histo ry provides specific information to indicate when, where, and how subjects  
involved  in an event tr aveled to a location (or  to mu ltiple locations), and convey ance 
data describes the veh icle in which the travel occur red.  Examples  of travel history 
include a pe rson’s loca l trave l as a part of the ir daily ac tivities as well as  the shipme nt of 
animals or plants from one country to another.

OM_RSv1.0 FINAL.doc 
Outb reak Management Functio nal Req uirements  Versio n: 1.0 
2.2.3.1  Travel history data should include infor mation such as the m ethod of 
transportation (e.g. bus, plane,  boat, car), flight num ber, departure and arrival 
dates and tim es, and the origination and destination locations (city, state, and 
country).   
2.2.3.1.a  Inform ation about each leg of a trip, as well as the parent inform ation 
about the trip, should be captured.  F or exam ple, if a person who lives 
in Georgia travels to Seattle and becom es exposed to m onkey pox, 
then visits a friend in Santa Fe, travel history and conveyance data 
should be noted acco rdingly for each place the exposed person 
traveled. 
2.2.3.2  Travel h istory data to be collected for an anim al or object should include 
shipping inv oices, an imal shelter d elivery and ad option receipts, and de livery 
schedules (including delivery ve hicle and driver inform ation). 
2.2.3.3  Detailed con veyance data m ust be collected when  relev ant to the 
investigation, including the carrier identifier,  the type of conveyance (such as 
airplane, bus, or train, among countless ot hers), as well as the m ake, m odel, 
year, and id entification num ber (e.g. , VIN) of each vehicle with which th e 
entity was in  contac t (if this inf ormation is r elevant to th e inv estigation ). 
2.2.4 Case Investigation and Exposu re Contact Data 
Case and exposure data provide more detaile d information beyond demographic data.  
Cases can be persons or animals, and exposur e contacts can be person s, animals, other 
organisms, or exposure settings , such as travel conveyan ce, location, organization, 
object, or event.   
2.2.4.1  Because attributes of both case and e xposure data m ay describ e the sam e 
entity, system s supporting OM m ust have the ab ility to avoid capturing 
redundant entity d emographic inform ation. 
2.2.4.2  Public Health Case Data 
2.2.4.2.a  Case data about the entity should in clude: a case identifier (i.e., Case 
ID) tha t is unique within  the jurisdiction be ing r eported,  the suspected  
agent, case diagnosis, health status (e.g., no symptom s, acute illness), 
case status (e.g., confirm ed, probable,  suspect), investigation dates, 
clinical history, sym ptom onset date and tim e, epidem iological links to 
other cases, and priority  (e.g., high, m edium , low).  
2.2.4.2.b  There m ust be a m eans to update the case diagnosis either m anually or 
autom atically if the case definition ch anges durin g an event. 
2.2.4.2.c  Epidem iological (ep i) data m ust be collected  to assist in the case 
investigation of events.  Standard epi data to be colle cted includes : 
onset date and tim e of sym ptoms, type of symptom s, risk factors, 
medical history data, laborator y data, procedure data, and 
questionnaire responses.   
2.2.4.2.d  System s supporting OM m ust allow  for dyna mic, event-specific case 
investigation data to be captured.

2.2.4.2.e  In the context of a case, all entities exposed to a case m ust be recorded 
and linked to the case. 
2.2.4.2.f  Demographic inform ation should be collected about the investigator, 
including their nam e, address, and contact inf ormation, so that the 
investigator m ay be contacted to answer questions or to provide 
additional infor mation. 
2.2.4.2.g  Both the jurisdiction investigatin g the even t and the jurisdiction  
reporting th e cases and  associated investigatio ns m ust be captured.   
For exam ple, if a person becom es ill during travel in one jurisdiction 
but is th e resident of  another, th e illness will b e reported by  the sta te 
(jurisdiction) of residence and inve stigated by the jurisdiction visited. 
2.2.4.2.h  System s supporting O M should have th e ability to cl assify entities 
associa ted with the investig ation  as investigation con trols.  For  
exam ple, controls  share  dem ographi c cha racteristics with the subjec t 
of the cas e, but are not in fected with  the ag ent th at is th e focus of the 
investigation. 
2.2.4.3  Exposure Contact Data 
2.2.4.3.a  Exposure investigation data to be captured m ust include inf ormation 
related to exposure levels, type of  exposure (e.g., intim ate, social, 
household, common conveyance), place of exposure, le ngth of tim e 
the entity was exposed, frequency of exposure, and the entity’s 
proxim ity to the source of exposure.  
2.2.4.3.b  Detailed data m ust be collected a bout the source of e xposure as well as 
the exposed entity to support contact exposure tracing.  Exposure data 
related to bo th the  poten tial source  and the po tential sp read inc lude th e 
entity’s type, Subject ID, Contact ID, contact’s na me and address, 
exposure dates and tim es, health  status, and priority code. 
2.2.4.3.c  Epi data m ust be co llected to  assist in the ex posure inv estiga tion of  
health events.  Standard epi da ta to be collected for exposure 
investigatio n para llels the data  to be collec ted f or case inv estigation 
and includes: onset date and tim e of sym ptoms, type of sym ptoms, risk 
factors, laboratory data, procedure data, and questionnaire responses.   
2.2.4.3.d  System s supporting OM m ust support capturing dynam ic, event-
specific data that describ es contact between two subjects.   
2.2.5 Monitoring and Follow -up Data 
Monitoring and follow- up data is used to track the progress and treatment of subjects 
who were exposed or potentially exposed to a health event.  For more information about 
monitoring and follow-up data, please reference “P HIN Countermeasure/Response  
Administration Functional Requirements and Pr ocess Flows”, available at

deploym ent packages, including syndrom ic grouping libraries and 
vocabula ry sub-sets, which will be u sed to ef ficiently co llect data 
specific to the particular hea lth event being investigated.  
2.7.4 Policies and procedures should be in pl ace for determ ining when follow up and 
isolation and quaran tine m onitoring should be done  as a part of a focused 
counterm easure adm inistration and response effort, rather than as a function of 
contact exposure tracing. 
2.8 SYST EM SECURITY AND AVAI LABILITY
