1.	Introduction
1.1.	Purpose 
This highly detailed Software Requirements Specification document explains and describes all of the agreed upon requirements that will be implemented for the VIRTUAL-EDU system, designed for NJIT. The document will provide the underlining structure of VIRTUAL-EDU, in a manner that both the Developers and the Customer will have a clear understanding of its functions, interface, design and constraints. Once the documents are approved by NJIT, it will also serve as a contract between the developers and NJIT.   
This document is intended to be read and utilized by the development team of VIRTUAL-EDU, including testers, programmers and project managers, the administrators of NJIT and any stockholder interested in seeing what NJIT is bringing forth to the university.
1.2.	Document Conventions
The outline of this document will follow the table of contents found on the second page of this document.
The outline is split into 6 sections.
Section 1 - Description of the purpose of the document and what it will contain.
Section 2 - Overall description of the project
Section 3 - Highly detailed description of the system functional requirements
Section 4 - External interface requirements that affect the system
Section 5 - Insight on other non-functional requirements
Section 6 - Glossary and DFD model diagrams of entire system
Each section is written with the intent that different users will read different sections.  The first two sections use universal language; while the next four sections use technical language.
The requirements will be explained by their level of importance.  Meaningful requirements will be describe first and less meaningful requirements will be describe last.  Every requirement will be mentioned and explained with the same high level of detail. 

The majority of the models showcased in this document will consist of data-flow diagram (DFD’s) 
1.3.	Project Scope
The project being developed for NJIT goes by the name of VIRTUAL-EDU. The requirements specified on this S.R.S. document coincide with the university’s  need for a new distance learning system which will enable professors to communicate more effectively with students via a Secure Application Platform that provides at the very least the following features (email, group chat, bulletin board, and audio/visual tools).  The proposed system will incorporate robust features such as audio and video capabilities, in which students within the same group or university can communicate via a portal that provides both visual & audio functionality, file hosting and file management, user profiles with pictures, better group collaboration tools, and online testing capabilities.
The document will satisfy our project scope by delivering well documented specifications, along with highly detailed models. Furthermore, it will contain comprehensive explanations of the functionality and constraints of each of the following requirements.
	Audio and video streaming capability/ podcasting (live and on-demand)
	File hosting and file management tools
	User profiles with pictures including integration with other campus resources
	Chat and group collaboration tools (Instant messaging)
	Online testing tools with instant grading

2.	Overall Description
2.1.	Product Perspective
Virtual-EDU consists of an online website that allows users to create a classroom like environment with the features that it contains. Once registered to the system, a user can create a profile sharing his or her information with the rest of the enrolled users. Users will be able to find commonalities with each other through the user profile. Virtual-EDU also gives users the ability to store data and/or important materials in a secure network location for future retrieval or present usage. This particular data as well as other files may be shared or worked on using Virtual-EDU extensive tools for file sharing and document collaboration. Users can work together on a single document in real time or send their work to other users via secure file sharing methods and protocols. If further communication is need between users, Virtual-EDU has features such as instant messaging, where users can hold single or group conversations via a secure real-time communication based on typed text. However, if more efficient means of communication are need, users have the ability to hold single or group video/audio conferences, whereby the users will be able to see other users streamed live in real-time.
The top level diagram below shows all of the user features that will be implemented for the system.
 
2.2.	Product Features
	Streaming audio and video (both live and on-demand) will allow users to interact with faculty and fellow classmates over a streaming video and audio, one-to-one or one-to-many connection. Also, learning materials can be delivered through audio and video formats.
	The instant messaging feature will allow users to interact with faculty and fellow classmates via text-based format, one-to-one or one-to-many connection.
	File sharing and document collaboration tools allow users to efficiently share and develop documents and reports within a group.
	User profiles containing contact information, pictures, and other related information on a student personal page.  This page will only be accessible to students and faculty enrolled in the same class. Only the owner of the profile may make changes to it.
	Users will have the ability to manage a private temporary hosting space. Tools such as file uploading, directory creator, move, delete and rename will be accessible.
2.3.	User Classes and Characteristics
System Administrators: User class with domain system privileges which allows them to maintain the entire system, manage enrollment and create virtual classes. Users in this class have complete control and knowledge of the entire system.
Administrative End User: User class with domain class privileges, which allows them to maintain and support the class they are enrolled in, along with the other enrolled users. Users in this class have zero knowledge of the back end of the system; however, they know the front end of the application. 
Limited End User: User class with limited class privileges, which allows them to operate the front end of the system with limited read only permissions. Users in this class will only be able to make modifications to their profile section.

Response:  Should upload the selected file and produce a window letting the user know if the upload was successful.  If no file is selected, a window should let the user know they need to use the Browse button to select a file.  If the upload will cause the account to go over disk space quota, the file should be still be allowed and an email sent to the administrator and professor letting them know of the overage.  The file tree diagram should update with the new file name added to the list.
3.4.3	Functional Requirements
	Virtual-Space Req 1:  FTP management software on the server setup with quota space, user authentication, and appropriate user rights.
a.	For the first release, each class needs a quota space of at least 1GB per student in that class.  If the upload will cause the account to go over disk space quota, the file should be still be allowed to upload and an email sent to the administrator and professor.  
b.	Files causing the quota to be exceeded should not be allowed to upload.  
c.	The students overall login should allow them access to the appropriate folder, and their account should only have Write privileges.  
d.	The professor’s username should allow them access to the appropriate folder and have Read, Write, and Delete privileges.  
e.	Firewall ports may need to be unblocked on both sides to accommodate file transfers.
	Virtual-Space Req 2:  Users need Windows XP, Vista, or Mac OS 
	Virtual-Space Req 3:  Users need Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari browser.
	Virtual-Space Req 4:  Users must enable pop-up windows.
3.5.	Virtual-Space V2
3.5.1	Description and Priority
In the second release of Virtual-ED’s Virtual-Space features would be added to include full file management for any uploaded files.  In this release, FTP space would be designated by student rather than by class section.  Disk space quotas would need to be implemented to preserve resources.  Each student would be able to upload files to share with team members or to turn in assignments.  Arranging by folders and deleting files would also be newly added capabilities.  
This would incur a higher cost to accommodate more disk space, and would also require an administrator to spend more time managing the FTP accounts.  The first release version of this feature was of medium priority, so adding more capabilities to it would be of low priority as email is still a highly usable alternative.
