UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 3 of 39 1 Summary  
1.1 Background  
The University Accommodation Management system, UAM, is a specialised student 
housing solution. Applicants for student accommodation register by completing an 
online application via a link from the University website.  
The Identity Management System (IMS)  was introduced to the University in 2008 
and is the University's system of record for identity information and primary web 
authentication. There is currently no automated integration between UAM and the 
IMS. 
In order to bring some efficiency and provide a better user experience for students it 
is desirable  to integrate the UAM system with the IMS – ensuring that a student only 
needs to register and update personal data in one system. Additionally, it wo uld be 
beneficial to pass various affiliation information from other University systems to 
UAM to keep them informed of any student ’s status changes.  
 
 
1.2 Scope  
The following items are considered to be in scope;  
 Integration with the IMS for the Accommodation Application process to eliminate 
the need for students/applicants to register and enter personal details in more 
than one system.  
 UAM Integration with IMS for any changes or updates to personal details for 
accommodation ap plicants or current students who have previously registered 
online . 
 The integration of relevant Affiliations a person has with the University to UAM as 
they are up updated in  the various downstream systems.  
 
1.3 Dependencies  
This project is dependent upon:  
 ITS resource being available to do the development  
 The accommodation package ( UAM) being able to integrate suitably with the IMS

Term  Meaning  
UAM 
 University Accommodation Management (UAM) system is the 
University’s specialised student housing solution . 
SAP The Student Administration Platform . 
IMS The Identity Management System (IMS)  is the University’s  master 
repository for Personal Data. It stores and maintains details of all 
persons that the University has a relationship with, inc luding 
students, staff, visitors, alumni and contractors.  
AfUE Application for University Entrance . This is an application for 
recording applications for admission to programmes of study at the 
University. It interfaces with the IMS for the Personal and Contact 
details of the applicants.  
ULN University Login  Name  – assigned to persons in the IMS when an 
Identity becomes resolved.  
 
  
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 5 of 39 2 Solution Overview  
When a prospective or current student wants to submi t an online Application for 
Accommodation at the University  they will use the links currently provided on 
various web pages, e.g. the University Home page  ‘Accommodation’ link , or via the 
Application for University Entrance (Accommodation Services link) .  
The solution for accommodation follows the pattern already established for similar  
web forms like the Application for University Entrance . Applicants visiting the 
Application for Acco mmodation for the first time will be required to register  
themselves  in the IMS and provide all the  necessary  personal data.  The applicant 
will then be transferred back to the accommodation form where their personal data 
will be displayed ‘read only’. A link back to the IMS will be provided in order that 
applicants can update personal data at any time.  
Additionally, it would be usefu l for Accommodation staff to have basic student -
related  information provide  to UAM from other systems , to assist them in process ing 
an applicant’s request for accommodation.  
 
3 Functional Specification  
 
3.1 Process  models  
3.1.1  Account  Registration  
Under an Integrated systems  approach , the ‘Account Login’ section on the University 
Accommodation Home  page  will direct the user to the IMS for Sign in . For someone 
who has previously registered with the university, they can use their Univers ity ID (7 
character number), ULN (if they are already a student) or the personal email address  
they used to create their account . If they are new to the University then they will be 
taken to the IMS registration screen (for Accommodation applicants).  They will be 
required to enter the following;  
1. Email Address  
2. First Name  
3. Last Name  
4. Password  
Following completion of this form and acceptance of the terms and conditions they 
will be sent a confirmation email. They will be required to complete the verificati on 
by clicking on the ‘Complete Your Registration’ link  and populating the following 
information (some of which is compulsory) .  
1. Title  
2. Middle Name s  
3. Preferred Name  
4. Previous Name  
5. Mobile Phone Number  (required)  
6. Home Phone Number  (required)  
7. Correspondence Address (required)  
8. Gender (required)  
9. Date of Birth  (required)  
10. Citizenship  (required)  
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 6 of 39 11. Residency (if not an NZ citizen)  
12. Ethnicity  (required)  
13. Emergency Contact details (required)  
14. National Student Number (NSN)  
Once this page is complete  the applicant can return to the Accommodation portal – 
Home Page and lodge an application . 
3.1.2  Completing an Acco mmodation Application  – IMS Identity Data   
Once an Applicant has either logged in or registered (in the IMS) and completed 
their verification they can begin a new Application , by selecting the ‘My Application’ 
link from the home page – as they do tod ay. The UAM system will recognize them  as 
being logged in, receiving their credentials from the IMS, using the 7 character  
unique University ID as the link between the two systems.  
The Select Application page of the UAM system will look no  different to how it is 
currently and once an applicant  select s their application type and click s on ‘Save and 
Continue’ - they will be transferred to the ‘Personal Details’ page. This page will be 
modified from what they see today, as all fields (not just  ‘Family Name’ and ‘First 
Name’) will be display only. A link will exist on the page to ‘Update Personal Details’ , 
which will transfer the user to the IMS (in a new browser window)  where they can 
maintain their own data. When they return to the ‘Personal Details’ page their 
applicant information will be updated with whatever was saved in the IMS. This will 
be a near real -time update.  
Similarly, with the ‘Contact Details’ page in the Accommodation Application – all 
fields will be read only with three separate buttons to link to different parts of the 
IMS for adding and/or updating Address es, Phone  & Email and Emergency Contact s 
details.  A new browser window will be opened in the  IMS on the appropriate page – 
and when saved will push a near -real time message to the Accommodation system 
to update anything that has changed.  
   
3.1.3  Synchronising Affiliation  data 
Some affiliations ( which represent the relationships a person has with th e University ) 
are displayed in the IMS. These are maintained in a number of University systems 
and sent via messaging to University Login Management system and LDAP  (which is 
where the IMS is reading these from). When these affiliations a re updated (or when 
a user is initially sent to the Accommodation system) these will be sent via m essage 
to the UAM database (for internal use only)  using an Application Programming 
Interface (API) - supplied by UAM. This will enable  administrators to have up to date 
information relating to an applicant’s (or current resident’s) status with the 
University. The Affiliations of interest to UAM are;  
a. Applicant  
b. Undergraduate Student  
c. Postgraduate Student  
d. Doctoral Student  Note: Where a UAM administrator enters an application on behalf of an applicant, 
they will need the ability to create the identity in the IMS first. Then they will enter 
the IMS ID number into UAM manually and push the person message from the IMS 
in order to populate the required personal data fields. This process for gathering 
personal data would also be the same for non-student accommodation residents, 
who are currently entered into UAM through the Administration pages. 
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 7 of 39 e. Alumni  
 
3.1.4  Other Student Related data  
NCEA Test Results  
When an applicant selects the ‘School Leaver’ option on the UAM application form 
they will be prompted for their National Student Number (NSN) i f it is not already 
stored against their IMS identity. Note : NSN will be included in the personal data 
collection once an applicant verifies their email address, but will be optional at this 
stage. When an applicant  proceed s to select their Accommodation Applicati on type, 
and they select Option 1 (School  Leaver) , a check on the database will be made to 
determine if their NSN number has been collected. If not, it will prompt t hem for it. 
When it is entered , or on confirmation that it has been entered , a web service will 
pull all relevant NCEA test data from the SAP database. Note: at this stage CIE and 
IB results sent from the Ministry of Education do not contain the NSN number so it 
will not be possible to collect these results automatically using the NSN number.  
 
Scholarship Information  
As part of the Education question in the Accommodation Application, information is 
gathered on whether an applicant has applied for or intends to apply for a 
scholarship. If an applicant has previously applied the information relating to this 
applicati on is currently  stored in SAP (though in the future this will be in Scholarship 
Management ) and could be retrieved by a web service and posted directly to the 
UAM database  via an API . The current scholarship question will be left in place,  for 
cases where applicants intend to apply or have applied for a scholarship that is not 
centrally managed, i.e. some facultie s manage their own scholarships.  
 
Photos  
All students are required to have an ID card photo entered in the university ID card 
system. A message is published from this system every  time a new photo is added 
for a student. There is a requirement for the UAM system to subscribe to this 
message where a student is a current accom modation applicant or resident . This will 
update the UAM database directly  via an API .

system is interested in as they are updated or added.  
 
3.4 Functional Requirements  
 
Requirement 
# Requirement Description  Navigation  Dependencies  
/ Traceability  
 
1 An Accommodation Applicant should 
only be required to register once with 
the University  in order to apply for 
Admission to a Programme of Study 
and to stay in a University Residence. 
A single ID should be used to access 
both Applications and eventually be 
used as their Student ID once they 
are accepted into a Programme.    
2 Personal and Contact Details required 
for the Accommodation Application 
should be created and maintained in 
the IMS. A user should be able to 
access the IMS to amend these details 
directly from an Application within 
UAM.   
3 The UAM system should b e updated 
automatically when a person (who is 
either an Applicant, a current 
University Accommodation  resident or 
who has been offered a place in a 
University residence) changes or 
updates their personal or contact 
details in the IMS.    
4 The UAM system should be updated 
automatically when a person’s (who is 
either an Applicant, a current 
University Accommodation resident or 
who has been offered a place in a 
University residence) affiliations with 
the university change.    
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 9 of 39 5 A report is required to  identify persons 
with current accommodation 
applications who a re not current 
students and who se application s for 
admission have been declined.     
6 A report is required to identify current 
University residents who are no longer 
active students (or w ere never 
enrolled) .   
7 Photos from a student’s id card are 
required to be sent to UAM when they 
are added or updated  in the ID card 
system .   
8 Secondary School details and NCEA 
results (from Year 12 onwards) should 
be sourced from SAP data (and 
populated in the UAM database) if this 
available at the ti me an applicant 
completes the form  – and we have 
received their NSN .   
9 Scholarship information should be 
pre-populated in the UAM database , 
from SAP, if it exists at the time an 
applicant completes the form .   
10 Hard Copy Applications – for those 
students that submit a hard -copy 
application, Accommodation staff 
require the ability to create user 
accounts in the IMS (on their behalf).  
They can then manually enter the IMS 
ID into UAM and then push the 
relevant person message from the 
IMS.   
11 Non-Student Applications – the 
business require the ability to process 
applications for non -students  also. 
These persons will still require the 
same IMS registration  (entered 
manually by UAM staff)  and be pushed 
from the IMS in the same way as is 
the case with manually entered 
student applicants .

1. NCEA Test Results and School Details  
 
Section 3 of the UAM Application (Section 4 for international  applicants) requires  Secondary 
School  details and results, Proposed Tertiary Study and Scholarship information – some  of 
which is asked for and stored in other Univer sity systems ; 
 
This is the current page in the Accommodation Application  
 
 
For NZ School Leavers who have NCEA results – they will no longer be required to fill out 
section a) of this form – as we would have collected their NCEA result and school 
information from SAP at the time that entered their NSN.  
 
However, the section wi ll need to remain (and be re -worded accordingly ). See sample 
below;  

 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 24 of 39   
 
 
2. Scholarship Information  
Section c) of this  application page should stay as it is. However, we will also be importing 
any SAP scholarship information (i.e. whether an applicant has  applied for a scholarship , 
and if so, the name of the scholarship) for accommodation applicants from the new 
Scholarship Management  system . These will only relate to  centrally administered 
scholarships and not those managed by the faculties . The Scholarship Management  online 
application system is currently in development and is unlikely to be available to provide this 
information at Go Live. Instead this integration will be turned on when Scholarship 
Management  is implemented. Given that the above question will remain  in the application 
form, UAM will continue to  capture this information manually from applicants.  
 
 
3.4.3  Synchronising Other Personal Data  
IMS Changes and Affiliation data  
When an affiliation  (of interest to UAM) is added to or removed from a  person that exists in 
the UAM database  (i.e. a current applicant , and past  or present University resident), a 
message  should be published from the IMS and subscribed to by UAM to update the 
person’s record . The IMS will send all Affiliation changes to UAM for all IMS identities, but  
will update only  those persons that exist in the UAM database , via an API.  Note: UAM is 
interested in any change to a pe rson’s identity record that is not captured by the processes 
in Section 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 of this document.  
The Affiliations of interest to UAM are;  

 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 25 of 39 a. Applicant  
b. Undergraduate Student  
c. Postgraduate Student  
d. Doctoral Student  
e. Alumni  
  
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 26 of 39  
Photos  
Along with the affiliation data - photos should also be published to UAM, and re -sent 
whenever they are updated  in the ID card system  – for students who are current 
accommodation applicants or residents  (as with the affiliation messages).  Currently,  there 
is an outbound message from the ID card system which UAM will subscribe to receive newly 
added or updated photos.  
Note: Given the size of the files in relation to photos it will be necessary for the UAM 
administrators to clean out phot os that are not required on a regular basis, e.g. for those 
applicants that never become residents . 
 
3.4.4  Reports  
Once Affiliation data is interfaced into UAM, the business will be able to better identify 
persons who are either currently staying at a Uni versity residence and are not entitled to 
(as they are no longer or never were a student) or have an outstanding accommodation 
application but have been refused entry to a programme of study at the University. Reports 
are required to be written that will u se the affiliation information of a person in the UAM to 
determine their eligibility to accommodation.  
Data required for the Report will be;  
a. UAM ID number  
b. University ID 
c. Legal Name  
d. Resident Status  
e. Resident Year  
f. Enrolment  Term 
g. Enrolment  Status  
h. Residence  
i. Current Affiliations

3.5.8.3  Citizenship  & Residency  
In UAM there are currently only 4 Citizenship Groups;  
1. NZ Citizen  
2. Australia Citizen  
3. Permanent Resident  
4. Overseas  
In the IMS Citizenship equates to the Country Code on an individual’s passport – currently 
there are 255 country codes (per SAP Country table) . The residency will be derived from the 
Citizenship (in the IMS), i.e. New Zealand and Australian citizens will be given residency of 
NZ and Australia. All other persons will be required to disclose whether or not they are 
permanent residents or if not, they will be deemed to be ‘Overseas’.  
 
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 35 of 39 3.5.8.4  Address Region s 
In UAM there are currently only 16 Regions available ag ainst the physical address. These 
are; 
1. Auckland  
2. Bay of Plenty  
3. Canterbury  
4. Gisborne  
5. Hawkes Bay  
6. International  
7. Manawatu Wanganui  
8. Marlborough  
9. Nelson  
10. Northland  
11. Otago  
12. Southland  
13. Taranaki  
14. Waikato  
15. Wellington  
16. West Coast  
In the IMS there is no Region validation. Instead, for NZ address there is in -built validation 
as you enter the address. For some foreign address there is State or County validation 
based on the country selected.  
 
  
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 36 of 39  
3.6 Configuration Requirements  
 
3.7 Non-Functional Requirements  
 
3.7.1  Security  
With the change to have users sign in to the UAM Application  using their IMS 
credentials , the sign -on security within UAM will have to be re -written to accept the 
IMS ID and passwords. It will be no less secure than it is currently and there should 
be no need for any change to roles and security profiles within UAM. This will be 
detailed as part of technical specif ication.  
3.7.2  Performance  
A change to master login information and personal and contact data within the IMS 
adds extra complexity and with it, potential for performance degradation. Any web 
service or messaging from the IMS to UAM should happen in near-real time, as it 
does with similar interfaces between the IMS and the AfUE or IMS and SAP. The 
users should not notice that they are in fact in another system and any transferring 
between the two should be seamless.  
3.7.3  Training  
Training will be required for UAM staff in regards to how the IMS should be used by 
Accommodation Applicants. There may be additional affiliation functionality within 
UAM that staff need to be trained in also.  
3.7.4  User Documentation  
This specification will provide the necessary information for staff to understand any 
new functionality and how the Application process will work once integrated with the 
IMS. 
3.7.5  On-going  support and maintenance  
The UAM system is currently and will continue to be supported by SMS. The 
Integration with the IMS will be supported by IT Service . Given the difference in some of the values stored in the IMS for Countries, 
Citizenship and Ethnicity, it will be necessary to change the current edit table values in
 UAM to be in alignment. Additionally, if the affiliation is to be brought into UAM 
there may be some configuration required to store these. 
 
UAM IMS Requirements Specification  | Version : 4.0 | Status : Draft   Page 37 of 39 3.7.6 Technical Approach – API’s and Web Services  
The UAM system has a number of Application Programming Interfaces (API) available to 
load data fr om external systems. UAM will subscribe to the existing IMS Person message2 
using the University’s Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) to create a web service to pass and filter 
the data coming from the IMS, which will then be processed by the relevant API.
