 1. Introduction  
1.1 Purpose  
The main purpose of this document is to provide a working example of a Software Requirements 
Specification  (SRS) based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 standard.  
Note:  This is an example document, which is not complete.  
1.2 Scope  
This document specifies requirements for a simple application for requirements management of 
software and system products . 
The application allows users to:  
• Capture requirements specifications  
• Manage requirements using custom attributes  
• Set up requirements traceability  
• Browse the requirements traceability matrix  
• Comment and review  requirements  
• Filter  and search requirements  
• Import  requirements from MS Word  or Excel  
• Export requirements to DOCX , XLSX ,  PDF, HTML , or CSV  
• Analyze requirements coverage and impact of changes  
• Print requirements specifications  
The application stores documents as human readable files with open file format.  
The application runs offline without connection to any server.  
Note:  The application functionality corresponds to ReqView  v1.0 released in 2015. Check all 
advanced requirements management features it offers now.  
1.3 Product perspective  
1.3.1 System interfaces

1.7 Assumptions and dependencies  
1.8 Definitions  
Custom Attribute:  Additional requirement property capturing additional requirements 
properties such as requirements source, status, priority, verification method, fit criterion, ...,  
Document:  A structured requirements specification capturing textual requirements for a given 
product or service.  
Link:  A directed association between related requirements allowing to analyze requirements 
coverage, gaps and impact of changes.  
Link Type : Pro perty of traceability links allowing to analyze links with different semantic 
independently, e.g., satisfaction and verification links.
