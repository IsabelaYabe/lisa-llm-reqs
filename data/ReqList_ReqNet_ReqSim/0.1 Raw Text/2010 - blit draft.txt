1Introduction
The management of [company name]. has identified a potential need for re-writing its core  
Laboratory Information System (LIS) to improve the performance. In general, this project  
will provide a stable environment, automate decisions, streamline workflows, and employ  
industry standard coding and documentation practices. This effort will ensure System  
Integrity/Reliability by developing a system that is reliable and low maintenance including  
security and confidentiality requirements as dictated by HIPAA and FDA regulatory  
standards.
1.1Purpose
This Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) is intended to capture the changes in  
functionality that will occur during [system name] Re-Writing effort, which is part of the xxx  
Enhancements project. All functionalities for the new [system name] system would be  
documented in this FRS. Any undocumented requirements will be considered out of scope  
and will not be implemented during this phase of Re-Writing.
1.2Scope
The existing functionalities in the core [system name] will remain same. This project is  
limited in scope to the enhancements and defects that are critical in the severity level that is  
the issues that cause great burden to the system users and the enhancements in system  
architecture, which will facilitate efficient growth of [system name] and the [company name]  
business, will fall under the purview of this project scope.
The functional issues and requirements that will be discussed and gathered respectively as  
well as validated in the Requirements Gathering and Validating Sessions started on  
MM/DD/YYYYwould be documented in this FRS moving forward. The project team has  
decided that system development will occur on module by module basis.
