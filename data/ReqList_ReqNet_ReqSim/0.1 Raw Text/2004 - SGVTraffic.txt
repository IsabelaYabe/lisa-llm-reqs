1.1 LA COUNTY TRAFFIC FORUMS 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works (County) Traffic Forum Program has 
proven successful in creating institutional infrastructure to coordinate the activities of the Agencies responsible for traffic signal operations in LA County.  These Traffic Forums allow groups of bordering Agencies to work together to promote inter-Agency cooperation.  The Traffic Forums have enabled funding to be targeted at infrastructure improvements along arterial and arterial/freeway corridors in the County’s sub-regions.  Such projects are a critical part of what will eventually be a network of integrated Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) projects in LA County and in Southern California. 
1.2 SAN GABRIEL VALLEY TRAFFIC FORUM 
The San Gabriel Valley Traffic Forum (SGVTF) is one such project that will result in arterial 
infrastructure improvements within the project boundaries.  The SGVTF project area ranges from Cities bordering the CA SR 110 and I-710 freeways to the west, I-210 freeway to the north, CA SR 57 freeway to the east, and the CA SR 60 freeway to the south.  It encompasses 24 municipalities as well as unincorporated portions of LA County.  The traffic signals in the Region are operated by many of the individual Agencies, the County, and Caltrans District 7. 
The goal of the SGVTF is to design, develop, and deploy an Advanced Traffic Management 
System (ATMS) specifically tailored to each Agency’s operations in the Corridor so that traffic signals can be synchronized and ITS systems integrated across jurisdictional boundaries.  The SGVTF project focuses on the specific needs of each Agency to manage their ATMS and recommends improvements to field infrastructure (e.g., controllers, detection systems, communications, etc.) and centralized Traffic Control Systems (TCSs) and/or Transportation Management Centers (TMCs) to meet those requirements.  When the SGVTF is successfully completed, each of the Agencies responsible for traffic signal operations will have full access to an ATMS that monitors and controls the traffic signals within their jurisdiction.  In addition, Agencies will be able to synchronize their signals and exchange traffic information in real-time with neighboring Agencies.  This will allow the Agencies to respond to recurrent and non-recurrent congestion in a coordinated fashion across jurisdictional boundaries. 
1.3 COUNTYWIDE INFORMATION EXCHANGE NETWORK (IEN) 
Developed by the County, the Countywide Information Exchange Network (IEN) is the 
integrated system framework that connects all of the individual Agency ATMSs into a Regional network to support the operational goals identified above.  As shown in Exhibit 1.1, the Countywide IEN supports traffic signal operations in three (3) levels: 
• Local Level 
• Comprises day-to-day traffic signal operations and maintenance (O&M) activities 
carried out by the individual Agency 
• Includes activities such as signal timings, equipment monitoring, response to local traffic conditions and events, etc. 
Integration System Requirements – Draft  
  
 San Gabriel Valley Traffic Forum  Page 1-2  December 23rd, 2004  Exhibit 1.1 – Countywide IEN 
 
• Corridor Level 
• Supports inter-Agency coordination and joint signal operations within the 
particular Traffic Forum (or Sub-Region) 
• Includes activities such as signal coordination across jurisdictional boundaries, 
monitoring and exchange of local traffic data throughout the Corridor, joint response to traffic conditions, incidents, and events that affect more than one 
jurisdiction, etc. 
• Regional Level 
• Permits arterials of Regional significance to be monitored, managed, and controlled as a single entity 
• Supports multi-Agency, cross-Corridor data exchange permitting a Countywide response to traffic conditions and major events 
• Facilitates communications between systems/Agencies not part of a Traffic Forum (e.g., Caltrans, LADOT, etc.). 
The SGVTF assumes the availability of the Countywide IEN at the Corridor and Regional levels.  
Therefore, the SGVTF project is focused on the selection of TCSs and the integration of those systems to the Countywide IEN at the local level.  The eventual ATMS design for the SGVTF will take into account the interface to the IEN and its requirements at the Local level and encompass the following six (6) core components: 

Integration System Requirements – Draft  
  
 San Gabriel Valley Traffic Forum  Page 1-3  December 23rd, 2004   
• ATMS and/or TCS (Individual Agency) 
• Detection and Surveillance 
• TMC and/or W/S Layouts (ATMS and/or IEN) 
• Communications Network 
• SGVTF Participation/Coordination (City-specific and/or SGVTF-Regional integration) 
• Operations & Maintenance (O&M) 
The Countywide IEN comprises the series of computer servers, communications, networks, 
graphical user interface (GUI) displays, etc. that integrates these components for the collection/transfer of data to support Corridor and Regional functions throughout LA County. 
1.4 PROJECT AREAS & AGENCIES INVOLVED 
The SGVTF Project encompasses several jurisdictions.  Furthermore, it will be integrated, or 
have the ability to integrate with other projects and existing systems in the Region through the Countywide IEN.  SGVTF Project Stakeholders include 24 local Agencies, the County, and Caltrans District 7 as the table below indicates: 
City of Arcadia City of Alhambra 
City of Azusa City of Baldwin Park 
City of Bradbury City of Covina City of Duarte City of El Monte 
City of Glendora City of Irwindale 
City of La Puente City of Monrovia City of Montebello City of Monterey Park 
City of Pasadena City of Rosemead 
City of San Dimas City of San Gabriel City of San Marino City of Sierra Madre

2.1 PURPOSE OF DOCUMENT 
This document represents the following deliverables: 
• Deliverable 2.3.6.1 – Integration System User Requirements (Draft) 
• Deliverable 2.3.7.1 – Integration System Functional Requirements (Draft) 
The above sub-tasks within the SGVTF’s Task 2.3 – Operational Concept and System 
Requirements were performed in parallel due to the close nature of the work activities involved 
within each.  Due to the fact that Functional requirements are inter-related with User requirements, both have been combined into a single document. 
The objective of this report is to identify integration system User and Functional requirements 
for the SGVTF.  The focus of these requirements is on back-end functionality supporting Center-to-Center (i.e., inter-jurisdictional) operations.  The intent is that these requirements will form the basis for the detailed design and implementation of the ATMS improvements within the SGVTF.  The success of the Project will be dependent upon each involved Agency's active participation in identifying critical issues and implementing systems to respond to these issues.  In previous tasks, the TransCore Team investigated/analyzed the existing ITS system inventory, identified operational objectives and system needs, developed the concept-of-operations for the SGVTF Project Stakeholders, and documented various ATMS User, Functional, and Facility requirements.  Building upon these findings, this document defines the integration system User and Functional requirements for the SGVTF Agencies so that systems can be designed and implemented that will support and address these needs. 
2.2 REFERENCED DOCUMENTS 
The following documents have been used as reference material in the preparation of this report: 
• San Gabriel Valley Traffic Forum Project 
• Deliverable 2.1.2 – Operational Objectives 
• Deliverable 2.2.2 – System Needs 
• Deliverable 2.3.1.1 – Concept-of-Operations 
• Deliverables 2.3.2.1 & 2.3.3.1 – ATMS User & Functional Requirements 
• Deliverable 2.3.4.1 – Typical Local City Traffic Signal Control Site Facility and 
Computer System Requirements Report 
• I-5/Telegraph Road Corridor Project 
• Deliverable 3.3.2 – Integration System User Requirements 
• San Gabriel Valley Pilot Project  
• System Design Report (Final, Version 1.0) 
2.3 REVIEW OF THE REQUIREMENTS PROCESS 
The User Requirements represent the first layer of requirements for the SGVTF Project.  The 
User Requirements specify the capabilities of the system from the User’s perspective in terms a User can understand.  This generates a common understanding of the systems by both the Users as well as developers. 
Integration System Requirements – Draft  
  
 San Gabriel Valley Traffic Forum  Page 2-2  December 23rd, 2004  Once the User Requirements have identified the desired capabilities of the system (with respect 
to integration), the second layer of requirements is the development of the Functional Requirements.  Typically, the Functional Requirements identify the elements of the system that are required to implement the User requirements.  This procedure enables a systematic approach to the first level of system architecture. 
The Functional Requirements describe the major system functions for each of the core system 
integration components.  In addition, all required system capabilities are expressed using “shall” statements to further indicate what the system must do and/or accomplish. 
The Functional Requirements presented in this report comprise a combination of the 
requirements for the Agencies in the SGVTF area.  Preparing the Functional Requirements for a specific system usually comprises the selection of the relevant requirements based upon the information contained in the User Requirements that detail Agency-specific features. 
2.4 DEFINITIONS 
Within this document, the following definitions are used: 
• LCCS (Local City Control Site) 
• All of the IEN and ATMS (if any) system components located at the local Agency 
• IEN (Information Exchange Network) 
• The hardware, software, and networking elements/components that facilitate the 
data collection, transfer, and management to support multi-jurisdictional traffic 
and incident management in the SGV and throughout LA County 
• ATMS System 
• The SGVTF ATMS elements/components that are controlled and operated by a centralized computer system 
• Users 
• SGVTF ATMS Project Stakeholder Agencies that use the System 
• Includes operators, maintenance technicians, operational supervisors, etc. 
• It should be noted that not all Users will have the same operational responsibilities or authority for control or operations of the ATMS 
• Administrators 
• Users who maintain ultimate authority on system control, operations, and maintenance of the system and system elements over their own jurisdictions 
• Other Users 
• Users who have no operational responsibilities and authority for control and operations of the system and the system elements 
The control and operations of the ATMS and/or IEN must be governed by system hierarchy 
levels, priorities, standard operating policies and procedures, and Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs).  These issues must be addressed during detail design for final agreement by all Project Stakeholders. 
Integration System Requirements – Draft  
  
San Gabriel Valley Traffic Forum Page 3-1  December 23rd, 2004  3. INTEGRATION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 
The following sub-sections identify the key User and Functional requirements for achieving 
traffic signal synchronization within the SGVTF Project area with respect to the back-end operations.  (Requirements describing the front-end functionality of the ATMS and IEN systems have been developed in previous documents [see Section 2.2] and communications will be addressed in Deliverable 2.3.8  - Communications User and Functional Requirements Report .) 
Each sub-section is made-up of relevant User requirements and derived Functional requirements.  
Functional requirements have been derived from the documents identified in Section 2.2, the Countywide IEN program, and current industry standards and best practices. 
The following numbering convention is adopted in this document with regards to the 
requirement numbers.  The alpha-numeric system by which the requirements are listed will be “type (INTG) “subject”-“requirement”, such as “INTG-DB-U01”, for integration requirements, database management, User requirement #1.  The first Functional requirement in the same section will be listed as “INTG-DB-F01 and so on. 
The requirements have been grouped into the classifications that follow in order to provide better 
ease of reference for the reader as well as to co-locate similar and/or associated requirements: 
• Security Requirements  – Groups together requirements controlling who can use the 
IEN, and what they can do once in.  
• Database Requirements  – Groups together requirements that describe what 
functionality the IEN database(s) need to provide. 
• Operational Requirements  – Groups together requirements describing how the IEN will 
support its inter-jurisdictional goals via the Command/Data Interface (CDI) & Site 
Server, network(s), and servers. 
• Maintenance Requirements  – Groups together requirements pertaining to the on-going 
maintenance of the IEN components.  
• Training Requirements  – Groups together IEN training-related requirements.  
3.1 IMPLEMENTATION OF REQUIREMENTS 
Please note that the timeframe in which a requirement is implemented is not addressed in this 
document.  Many components of the IEN have already been built and deployed within the San Gabriel Valley Pilot Project (SGVPP).  Not all of the requirements in the sections that follow have been implemented in the SGVPP version of the IEN or TCS systems/components, but should be realized in subsequent rollouts.  Those future requirements will be shown in italics  
and the timing of the implementation of the future requirements has not yet been determined.
