PRO DUCT CON STRAINTS
1.1 Purpose  of the t he Product
1.1.1  Backgroun d to the Project  Effort
The need for a  method  of visu alisati on of bio logical data has been identified. Cur rently, there are
many groups off ering many different tools fo r visualising data. Th ese visu alisation t ools provide a
range from tabular to three-dime nsional graphical views. How ever, a need has been identified f or a
tool t hat can display data in a three dime nsional environment,  which allows th e use r to inv estigate
the dat a and easily see various  attribut es of th e data at a glance.
A ne ed for the above -mention ed tool  ha s been identified and, th ere being no appl icable tool
available, a p roject to create such a  tool was conceptualised.
The primary stakeholder (see 1.2.1 ) has made  the case that the tool to  be created is of r elevance use
and t here is a r eal need for it. T his need is established th rough cont inual use of other similar tools
and a  continu ed id entification o f their sho rtfalls.
1.1.2  Goals of the Product
We want to g ive the user the abil ity to visua lise and inv estigate their data in a three dimensional
environme nt. The user should h ave the ability to see (at a glance) the differences of various selected
attribut es of th eir data.
The overall goal of this produ ct is to p rovide the users with somethin g that has previousl y been
unavailable.

1.4.4 How Long to Develop?
The Grid 3D appl ication w as originally developed t o be included for a scientific paper to be
publish ed at some point in M arch 2005. I t was, therefore, essential that the appl ication be ready by
then. Th e motivation for  developin g the application wit hin this sho rt time  frame was to, fir stly,
included it in th e pap er, but also to p roduce an original produc t in a constantly advancing genre.

1.5 Naming  Conven tions and Definitions
This section s hall provid e a di ctionary containing the meanin g of al l the name used wit hin this
requirements spe cification do cument.
Biolo gical data – data of a biol ogical scientific n ature generated by some  produc t or process
(exter nal to th e Grid 3D appli cation). To use  the biological d ata with th e Grid 3D
appli cation, it must  be fo rmatted i n the specified mann er (see         ).
Dem onstrator – r efers to a u ser of th e Grid 3D appl ication. T he demonstrator uses the three
dime nsional view generated by the appl ication t o demonstr ate one or more properties of the
data to any other person.
Grid 3D – th e application f or whi ch this do cument  cont ains the requirements. F or a detailed
representation of the  Grid 3D app lication, please refer to th e Design do cument.
Identifier – refers to a u ser of the Grid 3D app lication. T he identi fier use the appl ication to
identify different “points of int erest”. For example,  a poi nt that is not cl ose to a ny other point
may be of interest. An identi fier may become an investigator.
Investigator – refers to a us er of th e Grid 3D appl ication. T he investigator uses the
appli cation in order to find de tailed information  about spe cific points. An inv estigator ma y
originate as an identifie r.
1.6 Assumptions
This section c ontains a list of assumptions that are to be made b y the developers.
The use rs hav e the computing s kill fo r basic operation of on e of th e ope rating systems
docume nted in 1.4.3. B asic operation entails:
•starting and terminatin g an op erating system se ssion
•use of a Jav a-enabled internet browser
•compe tent use of k eyboard and mouse
•basic file handli ng
•command line input s kills
The use rs hav e access to a m inimum specification work s tation on whi ch to ru n the product.

2.1.1 .2 Running
The cont ext diagram a bove represents the  Grid 3D app lication during the initialisati on stages. It is
import ant to diff erentiate this with the work c ontext for the application in  a state of runnin g. The
following diagram aims to describe the wor k cont ext for the application w hen it is being run by the
users (identifie d above). In the followin g diagram, the users are grouped as one ent ity. This is fo r
conv enience only and should  be thou ght of a s separate ent ities. However, the work context applies
to each of th em in th e same manne r and, therefore, have been grouped to fu rther the simplicity and

2.2 Functional  and Data Require ments
2.2.1 Functional  Requirements
This section d escribes the functi onal r equirements fo r the Grid 3D a pplication. Ea ch functional
requirement should  have a fit cr iterion in o rder to mak e it possible t o test whether the r equirement is
impleme nted as specified in th e delivered produ ct.
The produc t shall plot the data points in a  scientifically correct mann er.
The grid axis should  be labell ed correctly according to the input f rom the data file.
Data points should be c oloured in a ccordance to th e cluster number ( contained in the  data
file)
The produc t should  be able to handl e up to  2000 d ata points.
A single click of t he mous e over a data point should bring up th e name of th e data point .
A doubl e-click of the mous e over the data point should cause the appl ication t o dis play all
the data point 's det ails.
The produc t should  allow multiple points to c licked s o tha t multiple  names can be d isplayed.
The produc t should  allow th e grid to be oriented by the user. Rotation, z oom and m ove
functions should  be emplo yed.
2.2.2 Data R equirements
The use  of th e Grid 3D a pplication invo lves the use r supplying a data file. This d ata file cont ains all
the info rmation of the points that a re to be plo tted.
The data file s hould c ontain:
A name for the data point
3 paramet ers from which th e data point  is to be plott ed
A single parameter to designate the colour of the point . This i s the attribute that is to be u sed
as the compari son.
A description fo r the data point.
In order for the grid to reflect the nature of th e user's data, the system should  allow for the user to
specify their own axis . With this in m ind, the first row  of the data file should contain the column
headings. T he followin g table propos es the format  for the data file.

NON- FUNCTION AL REQUI REMENTS
3.1 Look  and Feel  Require ments
The produc t is to be u sed pr imarily by research scientists and the refore mus t have a look  and feel
appropriate for this use .
These requirements are:
The poin ts should b e large enough to see and select
The poin ts should not  be too bi g, so as to dis tort the overall pattern of  the point  spread.
The axis should be clearly labelled and easily recognised after the grid has been oriented int o
a different position.
The appli cation should b e colou red so that the screen shots ca n be printed out cl early (i.e.,
black on whit e background).
The appli cation should b e intui tive and not r equire any specialist trainin g.
3.2 Perfo rmance Require ments
This section a ims to spe cify some  of the t iming and p erformance constraints to w hich the p roduct
will a im to adhere.
The program should  start within 30 s econd s
•This depends on the number o f data points that are to b e plott ed.
The interaction wit h the data points should hav e a delay of no lon ger than 2 s econds.
The response to a  change in the orientation shoul d be fast enou gh to avoid inte rrupt ing the
user's flow of thou ght.
