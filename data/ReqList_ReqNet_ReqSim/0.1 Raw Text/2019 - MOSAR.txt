1 Introduction  
1.1 Purpose and Scope  
The purpose of this document is to provide the system requirements for MOSAR that are derived from 
the from the SRC Compen dium document , the analysis of the modular spacecraft applications and 
relevant technology review  (including previous OGs building blocks) , the MOSAR operational concept 
and the demonstration scenarios.  
The document is mainly divided in two parts. The first part addresses the extraction of requirements 
associated with future space mission scenarios of modular spacecraft applications. They are mainly 
derived from the analysis of the most promising use cases of On -orbit reconfiguration and the associated 
technological needs  (RD2-D1.2) . These requirements are considered as  guidelines for the development  
of the MOSAR demonstrator, to target a good representativeness  of future missions.  
The second part addresses more specifically the technical requirements of the MOSAR demonstrator 
that will be designed, developed and tested during this activity.  The requirements are described at 
system level, for each of the main sub -systems and for the validation phase.

2 Modular Spacecraft  Requirements  
2.1 Mission Overview  
The selection of the MOSAR space mission application has to be done in perspective with the other 
space mission applications selected for PULSAR  and for EROSS:  
ï· PULSAR space mission will consist in assembling a large telescope at Earth -Sun L2 point 
using a robotic manipulator, with all the telescope and platform elements packaged in a single 
launch.  
 
ï· EROSS space mission will consist in the in -space  servicing of a LEO satellite, with refueling  
and units replacement, using state -of-the-art robotic arm and equipment.  
Following the analysis of RD2, a mission conce pt is proposed that exploits at best the benefits of the 
modular approach, that is realistically feasible in the short/mid -term and that is commercially oriented 
towards the reduction of costs and the maximization of profit.  
The proposed MOSAR space missi on application consists in upgrading, reconfiguring and repairing an 
operational GEO telecommunication satellite.  
The satellite, in its original configuration, will have an initial telecommunication payload capacity and will 
be assembled and tested on -ground, but it will feature key design concepts to meet the mission 
objective:  
ï· Modular design:  
The satellite original configuration will be based on the conventional all -integrated platform, 
but will feature some specific modules, removable from the outside o f the satellite, dedicated 
to power generation (solar array + power conditioning) and payloads.  
 
ï· Scalable design:  
The satellite original configuration will allow in -space connection of additional modules through 
standard interfaces at the outside of the satellite.  
 
The mission is divided into 3 different phases:  
ï· Phase 1: launch of satellite with initial capacity  
The satellite is assembled and tested on -ground and is launched fully integrated into a GTO. The 
satellite then uses its own propulsion system to  raise its orbit to reach its GEO position slot.  
After in -orbit tests and commissioning, the satellite is capable to deliver an initial capacity (e.g. high 
throughput internet connection).  
 
ï· Phase 2: capacity increase + upgrade of payload + addition of host ed payload  
After several years in -orbit (approximately 5 years), there is a need coming from the market to upgrade 
the payload (removal of obsolete technologies) and to add telecommunication capacity to the existing 
satellite, while also adding an hosted p ayload for meteorology on the Earth pointing panel to increase 
financial revenues and profitability.

Dedicated modules (power generation module, payload modules, hosted payload module) will be 
manufactured, tested on -ground and launched into GTO (can be a co-passenger with another GEO 
satellite). A servicer equipped with a robotic arm and positioned near the GTO injection point, will then 
capture the modules, bring them to the satellite operational orbit (i.e. perform an orbit raising and 
insertion into GEO  slot of its client) where it will assemble them with the following sequence:  
o Addition of power generation module and in -orbit tests for verification of performances  
o Removal and storage of obsolete payload modules  
o Replacement of obsolete payload modules and in -orbit tests for verification of 
performances  
o Addition of telecommunication payload modules and in -orbit tests for verification of 
performances  
o Addition of hosted payload module and in -orbit tests for verification of performances  
 
ï· Phase 3: replacemen t of failed battery + addition of deorbiting propulsion kit  
After additional years of operations, failure of parts subjected to ageing (e.g. battery, thrusters) occurred 
preventing the satellite from operating nominally and performing specific station keep ing maneuvers  
(e.g. E/W or N/S).  
Dedicated modules (battery module, propulsion kit) are manufactured, tested on -ground and launched 
as co -passenger to another GTO mission. As for Phase 2, a servicer will capture and bring them to the 
satellite operational orbit and perform the modules exchange.

This mission concept is proposed as an example, to guide the development of the demonstrator. 
However it should not limit in any way the applicability of MOSAR to any other kind of mission.  
MOSAR is a project aiming at demonstrating a set of key technologies that are considered essential for 
the development of future applications of On -Orbit Servicing and On -Orbit A ssembly. The objectives of 
MOSAR include ( AD3):  
ï§ Review, extension and integration of common robotic building blocks: ESROCOS, ERGO and 
InFuse software building block s; I3DS perception suite and SIROM standard interface.  
ï§ Development of a repositionable walking manipulator, enabling a cost -effective solution for 
actuation on a wide workspace without escalation of size and performance of the robot.  
ï§ Elaboration of a con cept for modular spacecraft: identifying key design choices and highlighting 
recommendations for development of standards for design and operation of future modular 
space vehicles.  
The first two objectives should be generic and independent from any specifi c mission, as the final 
purpose is to develop a standard that is unique and re -usable across different missions. As for the third 
objective, the applicability of the modular approach to different missions is discussed in RD2, highlighting 
the main advantages that modularity would bring to specific applications and the main design and 
operation requirement that would need to be fulfilled.  
2.2 Space Scenarios  Requirements  
MOSAR does not target a specific mission in particular, but rather aims at demonstrating key 
functionalities that are intended to be generic and applicable to very different scenarios. Therefore, it 
has been preferred not to restrain MOSAR applicability to a given mission, but to presen t general 
requirements that can be common to multiple missions. These requirements are not  expect ed to be fully 
verified in the context of the current project. They should be considered as guidelines for the 
developments in th e current activity to favor  compatibility with future mission goals and requirements.

3 MOSAR Demonstrator Requirements  
3.1 Demonstrator Overview  
The purpose of the MOSAR demonstrator is to illustrate scenarios of modular spacecraft assembly and 
re-configuration operations. The baseline scenario is the one of a Servicer Spacecraft (SVC) 
transporting a cargo of Spacecraft Modules (SM) and a dedicated  Walking Manipulator (WM), 
performing a number of operations with the transfer of SM from and to the Client Spacecraft (CL T) by 
the manipulator.  
 
Figure 3-1: MOSAR Demonstrator Concept  
Spacecraft Modules are  individual structures associated with a specific function of the spacecraft, that 
once assembled, will ensure the spacecraft operations. They can cover system (ASM, Active System 
Modules) or payload (APM, Active Payload Modules) functions. The SM are equi pped with Standard 
Interfaces (SI) enabling Modules to Modules and Modules to spacecraft connections. Each SI provides 
mechanical, data, power and thermal transfer capabilities, allowing a full configuration of the CLT 
functions. That includes mechanical s tructural integrity, data transmission, power routing and thermal 
management along the elements.  
The main purpose of the manipulator is to transfer the SM between the servicer and the client satellite. 
In order to answer the problem of reachability, the MO SAR concept is based on the implementation of 
a walking manipulator that ensures a high mobility along the structure. Equipped with Standard 
Interfaces at its both end -effectors, it can attach and manipulate the SM, but also move along the 
structure by con nection to either the SM or the spacecraft SI. The connection is also used to power the 
arm and transfer the control commands coming from the spacecraft computer.  
The autonomous transfer and configuration of the SM follow an execution plan prepared and va lidated 
off-line, in the Monitoring and Control Centre (MCC), on the ground segment. The MCC includes a 
satellite design, modelling and validation tool, specifically targeting modular satellites applications. It 
also allows the automatic planning of the as sembly or reconfiguration sequence that can be verified with 
a multi -physics simulator. All these elements are working iteratively together to prepare a valid execution 
plan that is finally uploaded to the spacecraft for execution. Based on the monitoring and feedback 
information received from the spacecraft during the operations (e.g. detected failed module), the MCC

verification and monitoring activities  during sequence execution.

4 Conclusions  
The overall system requirements and associated verification methods are described in this document, 
detailing the specific requirements for each of the high level subsystems. They reflect the consortium 
analysis and vision of MOSAR system requirements to d evelop the demonstrator reflecting the proposed 
concept of space modular spacecraft and operations.  This document will serve as a baseline for the 
preliminary design analysis, including the detailed system architecture, interfaces definitions between 
subsystems, the detailed technical requirements of the equipment  and their respective preliminary design 
that shall be consolidated by the end of M9 (PDR milestone).
