 1. Introduction 
1.1 Purpose  
The USDA and Agricultural Research Service (ARS ) have supported hydrologi c research since the 
1930's and many of the research watersheds are s till operational.  However, data have been 
managed and made available independently at  each research location, greatly reducing the 
accessibility and utility of these data for polic y-relevant, multi-site analyses.  The ARS is 
developing and implementing a data system to or ganize, document, manipulate and compile water, 
soil, management, and economic data for assessm ent of conservation practices. While primary 
responsibility for data will continue to reside at  individual watersheds, the new data system will 
provide one-point access to data from the sites in well-documented, and standardized formats.  The 
purpose of this document is to describe the techni cal and operation requirements that meet the needs 
of the CEAP Watershed Assessment Studies, as we ll as additional needs of researchers at the 
watershed sites and diverse outside users, in adeq uate detail to provide the basis for the system 
design.  The system will be called STEWARDS: Sust aining the Earth's Watersheds – Agricultural 
Research Data System.  
1.2 About this Document and its Readers 
The system requirements specification document desc ribes what the system is to do, and how the 
system will perform each function. The audiences for this document include the system developers 
and the users.  The system developer uses this document as the authority on designing and building 
system capabilities.  The users review the documen t to ensure the documentation completely and 
accurately describes the intended functionality.   
This version – version 1.0 - provi des general descripti ons of the system.  The system developer 
should review the document to ensure there is adequa te information for defining an initial design of 
the system.  The users should review the document to  affirm the features described are needed, to 
clarify features, and to identify additional features needed within the system.   
 The next version – version 2.0 – will be the result of more detailed requirements analysis.  When 
version 2.0 is written, the system developer and users will be as ked to review this document. 
The document is structured to follow IEEE 830-1998 st andards for recording system requirements.   
1.3 Project Scope 
As part of the Conservation Effects Assessm ent Project (CEAP), twelve ARS Benchmark 
Watersheds will support watershed-scale asse ssment of environmental effects of USDA 
conservation program implementation. The ARS Benchmark Watersheds represent primarily 
rainfed cropland, although some of the watershe ds also contain irriga ted cropland, grazingland, 
wetlands, and confined animal feeding operations. Three additional ARS watersheds may be added 
in the future to represent additional land uses. C onservation practices to be emphasized will include 
NRCS CORE 4 practices for croplands (cons ervation buffers, nutrient management, pest 
management, and tillage management), drainage  management systems, and manure management 
practices. Environmental effects and benefits wi ll be estimated primarily for water and soil 
resources, with some assessment of wildlife habita t and air quality benefits in some watersheds. 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 2 
  
The goal for the watershed-scale research is to  provide detailed assessments of conservation 
practices and programs in a selected wate rshed, provide a framework for improving the 
performance of the national asse ssment models, and support coordina ted research on the effects of 
conservation practices across a range  of resource characteristics (suc h as climate, terrain, land use, 
and soils).  The basic requirement for STEWARDS is to deliver  consistent high quality data in support of the 
CEAP 
watershed-scale assessment from a one-stop data portal to the CEAP clients and, in time, the 
public at large. The data system consists two ma in parts -- a central database management system 
for the storage and management of data, and a clie nt application to allow users access and interact 
with the data. The data stored in the database can be viewed and downloa ded using graphical and 
tabular interface tools.   The data system will serve as a repository where diverse end-users can access, search, analyze, visualize, and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations.  Types of data will be diverse, including  biophysical data (i.e., point-based in time and/or 
space, spatially variable data, ti me series), data about land use, management, and conservation 
practices; and economic data .    Where applicable, data from  the NRCS, Economics Research 
Service (ERS) Agricultural Resources and Environm ental Indicators database, other ERS sources of 
data on costs of conservation practices, and la nd use and management data of NASS or other 
agencies will be utilized.  The intention of the team is that ARS researchers at watershed locations retain primary responsibility for data collection and management.  Sites ma y chose to retain existing data 
management protocols or change location pr otocols to those of STEWARDS.  However, 
STEWARDS must have the capability to translate data from location-specific formats into the standardized STEWARDS formats.  Data on STEWAR DS will not be available to the public in real 
time.  Access to real-time data will remain at the discretion of each location research team.  Instead, 
annual or more frequent updates from location databases to STEWARDS will be made by the 
watersheds’ staffs after the locations have completed their quality assurance procedures.

2. Overall Description 
2.1 Product Perspective 
This product is a new, centralized data system.  Source data for this system are the long-term ARS 
watersheds, with those participating in the CEAP project expected to participate in this data system 
first. 
2.2 Product Features 
The data system consists two main parts -- a centr al database management system for the uploading, 
storage, and management of data, and a client application to allow users access and interact with the 
data. Diverse end-users can access, search, analyze,  visualize, download, and report various types of 
integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations.  Types of data will include biophysical data (i.e., point-based in time and/or sp ace, spatially variable da ta, time series), data 
about land use, management, and conservation practices; and economic data. See figure 1. 
  
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 4 
 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics 
The user classes of this database system will be  
 
UCC-1: System operator: Staff at OCIO responsib le for maintaining executable code, requiring full 
access to all aspects of the system. 
 UCC-2: Data operations manager: Staff, probabl y at OCIO, responsible for data archiving and 
maintenance, requiring read/write/modify privil eges to all data in the system.  This 
includes the role commonly thought of as a Database Administrator (DBA). 
 UCC-3: Watershed uploaders: Staff in the watersheds  who have responsibility to upload local data 
requiring write access to space alloca ted to their specific watershed. 
 UCC-4: ARS users: ARS scientists, engineers, a nd support staff who requi re ARS watershed data 
for research purposes. These would likely be co nversant with the gene ral characteristics of 
the data content, and to a lesser extent have abilities manipulating vi ews of the data using 
database tools such as envisioned for this  database system. These users will need 
user/password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to 
data protected through the confidentiality ag reements among agencies participating in 
CEAP. 
 UCC-5: Research users: Non-ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS 
watershed data for research purposes. These w ould have similar characteristics and needs 
as ARS users, but because of the agency-lev el confidentiality issues, could not access the 
password-protected sensitive data.  
 UCC-6: Public users: Eventual release of the database system to the general public will add 
university and agency research ers who would appear similar in training to the primary 
users, but also would add clients with the enti re range of training and interests. These users 
would have access to the public data  without need for authentication. 
2.4 Operating Environment  
The rule for selecting hardware and software is that the components/application must be 
functionally efficient, capable of interfacing with other soft ware, and easy to maintain. 
 OE-1: The System shall operate with the follow ing Web browsers: Micros oft Internet Explorer 
versions 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator ve rsion 4.7, Netscape versions 6 and 7, and 
FireFox. 
 OE-2: The System shall operate on Certified and Accredited servers running the current 
corporate approved versions of operating systems as appropriate. 
 OE-3: The Data Management portion of the system shall permit user access from the corporate 
Intranet and, if a user is au thorized for outside access thr ough the corporate firewall, from 
an Internet connection at the user’s home. 
 OE-4: The Data Research and Re porting portion of the system sh all provide public access to 
reviewed and approved data sets. 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 5 
 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints 
The goal of the web application is to be platform independent on the client side wherever possible.  
Therefore, the web applications will be implemented to run on the server side as much as possible. 
Also, it is required to test the application usin g different platforms, connection speeds, screen 
settings, colors/graphics, and browsers.   CO-1: Portability: The application codes gene rated during prototypi ng may not run properly 
when re-hosting the data system to a non-Windo ws OS or transferring the data system to 
another location.  
 CO-2: Database Design: The database structure should be as complete as possible during the 
design stage but there should be a room for modification without a large overhaul during 
later phases. 
 CO-3: Data uploading and management will likely be done as infrequently as once a year.  This 
fact greatly limits the complexity of the us er interface and the learning curve needed for 
completing this task. 
 CO-4: The system shall use the current corpor ate standard Microsoft SQL Server database 
engine. 
 CO-5: The system shall be in compliance with  all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security 
policies applicable .  
 CO-6: As part of standard operating procedures , a testing plan will be documented during the 
Design phase . The testing plan will be based on user  roles, modules or use cases, required 
tasks and expected outcomes. 
2.6 User Documentation 
User documentation will consist of the several com ponents usually expected of a modern web-based 
software application, incl uding a tutorial, help pages, FAQ’s with an online request form, and a 
complete user’s manual.  UD-1: A tutorial will provide a quick start, a wa lk-thru of major system features, and further 
reference source for the complete system features. 
 UD-2: An online hierarchical and cross-linked help  system in HTML will describe and illustrate 
all system functions. 
 UD-3:  An online form will enable users to re quest help. Frequently asked questions will be 
screened for the FAQ pages. 
 UD-4: The user's guide (or user manual) will contain sufficient information and instructions 
required to access and use the da ta system.  It will include: 
UD-4.1. Overview of the system f eatures and architecture. 
UD-4.2. Instructions for accessing the system. 
UD-4.3 . Samples of screens, where appropriate. 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 6 
 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies 
It is anticipated that each watershed location wi ll provide human and fiscal resources required to 
prepare metadata files, data files, work with the data team on initial import of data, perform 
subsequent data uploads, and provide site-specific support to users of the sy stem.  If a location has 
inadequate resources, the minimal data required for CEAP analyses will be id entified and the data 
team will provide additional support to that locati on.  This may result in a location’s data coming 
into the system later than scheduled.  Team leaders anticipate availabil ity of the operational platform at the ARS OCIO level.  Pilot and, 
as a contingency, operational data systems may be developed and maintained at El Reno or other 
research locations.  It is anticipated that funding from NRCS will par tially support this activity through FY07.  If that 
funding were not available or insu fficient in future years, base funds at the locations and/or 
discretionary funds from the Area and Headqua rters funds would support the activity but the 
timelines would be adjusted.    Help desk funding will be determined from sta ffing needs identified during the design phase and a 
proposal will then be made to NPS. 
3. System Features 
3.1 Database Management System 
The standardized data structure wi ll facilitate database developm ent, storage, and maintenance; 
metadata development, storage, and maintenan ce; and support database functionality, including 
tabular and spatial data queries,  evaluation, visualization, and tran sfer (downloading) to off-site 
locations. 
3.1.1 Description and Priority The database management system should be stable and secured, have high pe rformance (in terms of 
speed and efficiency/effectiveness), and be easy to ma intain. This component is central to the effort 
and is thus of highest priority. 
3.1.2 Use Case Scenarios 
The team will elicit user requirements from a cross- section of user class me mbers (see section 2.3) 
to accurately and completely describe the expected uses and functionality of the system.  To elicit 
requirements, the user class members will be as ked via conferencing, interviews, and email, to 
provide a detailed description of  the user actions and system re sponses that will take place during 
execution of the use case under normal, expected conditions. The summation of responses will lead 
to an accurate and complete inventory of user requirements.  
3.1.3 Functional Requirements FR-1:  DATABASE 
 
FR-1.1: Database design 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 7 
 Establish a database in support of CE AP that will house the collective data 
assembled or generated during research ac tivities.  The database will support a 
variety of data types and formats, includi ng but not limited to: sp atial data - vector, 
raster, imagery, and tabular; tabular data  – static and time-series; spreadsheets; 
documents; reports; photographs; and URL links. 
FR-1.2: Modeling support 
The use of agricultural models (SWAT, AnnAGNPS) is a core element of the 
CEAP effort.  Several modeling-related data base topics will need  to be addressed: 
1. Maintenance and reporting of uncertainty or error in measured data, in spatial 
components of GIS data, and in modeli ng output. Reporting of uncertainty may 
take place on an individual sample basis, on a method or procedural basis, or on an entire database. 
2. Models will require specific input data and will generate output data during the 
calibration and validation phases, sensitivity analyses, and exploratory scenarios.  The current scope of the STEWARDS system is to provide measured data for input 
to the model and for comparison to output. 
FR-2:  DATA ACCESS 
FR-2.1:  View entire universe of watershe ds from top-level screen for selection 
Design tools to navigate the individu al watershed sites and their data. 
FR-2.2:  View waters hed descriptive data 
Summary descriptions of research waters heds, stations, and in struments that are 
useful in describing the research activities  should be accessible.  This information 
would not be considered ‘formal’ metadata. 
FR-2.3:  Browse, query, and download individual sampling st ation data and metadata 
Provide access to the data via browsing of sites, stations, and instruments; allow 
for simple queries to individual datasets; provide a metadata s earch tool to query 
dataset parameters; and allow for downloa ding of datasets (full or partial). 
FR-2.4:  Visualize time-series data 
Users may wish to examine time-series data, e.g. stream discharge data, over a 
user-specified time frame in order to sele ct only those data desired for download.  
Charting tools in association with the query engine are desirable. 
FR-2.5:  Generate tabular reports of selected data 
Provide access to CEAP-related report s, tables, and project documents. 
FR-2.6:  Visualize, query, and download spatial data 
Agricultural research data are inheren tly spatial in nature.  STEWARDS will 
provide web-based geographic information tools to allow site-specific data to be 
viewed within their spatial context.  These tools will provide browse and query 
functionality and support links to downloa d spatial data and their associated 
tabular data. 
FR-2.7:  Browse, visualize, and downloa d agricultural modeling data and results 
Much of the initial effort in CEAP wi ll focus on the use of agricultural models 
(e.g. SWAT, AnnAGNPS) in the CEAP wa tersheds.  Users will be able to 
examine the data used in the modeling effo rt, visualize the results in their spatial 
context, and download the mode l input data and results. 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 8 
 FR-3:  METADATA 
FR-3.1:  Maintain metadata database 
Develop and maintain a metadata database that provides browse and query access 
to formal descriptions of the database  elements.  Provide tools for database 
contributors to create and upload meta data compatible with the STEWARDS 
metadata database. 
FR-3.2:  Browse and query watershe d metadata by theme or location 
Develop search tools that query waters hed, station, and inst rument metadata 
across the STEWARDS database.  Meta data query tools will support query by 
location, theme, and keyword. 
FR-4:  SYSTEM SUPPORT 
FR-4.1:  Administrative metrics – user access lists, data download estimates 
FR-4.2:  User feedback, user support tools FR-4.3:  Conform to USDA web site style guide 
3.2 Metadata Availability  
Metadata are data about data. Th e STEWARDS database will main tain a metadata report for each 
database in STEWARDS. The meta data of individual datasets s hould be created at the local 
watershed sites for local use and for populating a CEAP metadata database. Elements of the 
STEWARDS Metadata system will include:  MA-1:    Metadata standard 
Adopt a metadata standard that is compliant with Federal regulations .  The current Federal 
standards for spatial data are the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata 
(version 2.0), (http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/contstan.html
), FGDC-STD-001-1998.  
There are some indications that the Fe deral government may implement the ISO 19115 
geographic information/metadata standard in th e future. If this occurs, the CEAP database 
team will evaluate conversion of metadata.  
MA-2:    Metadata input tool 
Implement a metadata input tool that suppor ts creating and editing of metadata in the 
chosen format.  The metadata tool will allo w for local and web-based input and editing. A 
likely scenario involves a web-ba sed wizard which allows users to specify particulars of a 
data set, and then save those an swers and relate them to a part icular project, so that these 
selections can be re-used in  future uploading operations. 
 
MA-3:    Metadata query system 
Implement a web-based browse-and-query to ol for searching STEWARDS metadata.  
Queries by location, theme, and keyword will be supported. A likely scenario involves a 
web-based wizard which allows users to specif y particular querying parameters and then 
save them for reference later such that time-based comparisons are facilitated with minimal user training.  
MA-4:    Metadata database 
Implement a database of STEWARDS metadata elements.  The database will provide browse and query functionality. 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 9 
 3.3 Data Dissemination 
To make data electronically available any place and any time through a web server-client service, 
the web service will be platform independent as much as possible. Where there is an exception, the 
software/hardware requirement should be specified  for a particular appl ication.  Users whose 
computing environment precludes downloading the da ta via the internet will have the opportunity to 
acquire data, reports, model results and other STEWARDS information via alternative media. 
3.4 Hardware requirements 
HR-1:     Data Storage 
HR-1.1: Online Storage - The system needs to be able to store hundr eds of megabytes of 
data on demand.  The potential for needing Giga bytes of data storage capacity is also in 
the realm of possibilitie s.  Further requirements gatheri ng is needed to get real-world 
estimates of such data storage needs. 
 
HR-1.2: Near-line Storage – All User and Application data as well as software installation 
and configuration files must be fully backed up week-nightly.  Further, secure, off-site 
storage will be performed on a weekly basis with 24-hour retrieval times.  
 HR-2:    Networking 
HR-2.1: Load Balancing -  Application Serv ers and Database servers must be load 
balanced at the application level to ensure maximum stability and availability.  Specific 
scenarios, such as fail-over versus session-ma naged load balancing need to be addressed in 
the functional requirem ents specification. 
 
HR-2.3: Private Network - The system require s a “back-end” private network environment 
in order to ensure that end-user operations (on the front-end) are not  impeded by database 
backups, index propagations, or othe r large back-end data transfers. 
 
HR-2.4: The system will use, where appropr iate, the standard hardware and data 
communications resources provided by the AR S OCIO at the ARS George Washington 
Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. This includ es, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet 
network/T1 connection at the server/hos ting site, network servers, and network 
management tools. 
3.5 Software requirements  
SR-1:  Backup Software – Data and application backups will be managed through fully supported 
backup software solutions. 
 
SR-2:  HTTP and GIS Server Applications – As  the Web will be the primary delivery protocol 
for the application, HTTP and related GIS server  applications will be required to support 
system functionality. 
 SR-3:  Web Browsers and Browser Plug-ins – In support of External Interface requirements, 
commonly supported web browsers will be used to implement a thin-client architecture.  
The use of Browser plug-ins will be judici ously restricted on an as-needed basis. 
 SR-4:  Email Services– As a secondary delivery protocol for alerts, data, and other information 
from the system, email server applications wi ll be required to support system functionality. 
 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 10 
 SR-5:  Relational Database Management System  - As the primary data storage mechanism for 
the corporate standard relational database management system, Microsoft SQL Server will be required to support system functionality. 
 SR-6:   The system will use, where appropriate, the standard software resources provided by the 
ARS OCIO.   This includes, but is not limite d to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C
++/C#, MS SQL 
server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache 
server. 
 SR-7:   The system will make data available in standardized data formats such as tab-delimited 
text for use on users’ client systems including local installa tions of ARC GIS software or 
other off-line software applications.   
3.6 Data migration to and retrieval from STEWARDS 
Data will be subject to quality assurance prio r to either initial or recurring uploading to 
STEWARDS. Initial population of STEWARDS will require that transition filters be developed 
jointly between the STEWARDS team and the individual watersheds. These filters will provide the same function for recurring, probably annual, uploads.  
3.6.1 Quality Assurance  
Local watershed staff will be responsible for perf orming necessary quality assurance/quality control 
(QA/QC) procedures prior to data being uploa ded to the STEWARDS database.  Measurement 
methods and QA/QC procedures es tablished by the CEAP Quality A ssurance Team will be used by 
local data producers and recorded in  the data provided to STEWARDS. 
 The purpose of quality assurance is intended to provide added assurance of data integrity. Quality assurance checking will be carried ou t at two different levels – local site level and central site level. 
First, the guidelines for quality assurance, incl uding parameter-specific ranges, threshold values, 
quality flags etc., will be determined. Quality assurance checking at the local sites may be performed before or during the standard exch ange file conversion phase. A general quality 
assurance checking, not as specific as  at the local sites, will be carr ied out during the data uploading 
stage. Note that a) the primary responsibility fo r data quality assurance re sts with the individual 
sites and b) the quality assurance ranges, criteria, etc., used here  should be consistent with the 
quality assurance information specified in meta data (and may be a component of  the data 
dictionary). 
3.6.2 Populating data   
Basic information regarding individual watersheds will be made available to STEWARDS by local 
watershed sites.  Basic information may include spatial data in a GIS-compatible format; descriptive data about stations, instruments, methods, or procedures; reports; m odeling results; and other data.  
Data will be reformatted to be compatible with  the STEWARDS data schema and CEAP modeling 
requirements.  Watershed data to be used in mo deling that does not conform to model requirements 
will be processed in STEWARDS for in clusion in the STEWARDS databases. 
 As part of the initial population of the database, time-series data (measurement data, annual land use 
information, weather/climate data) that has been co llected by local watershed staff will be processed 
through local and CEAP QA/QC procedures a nd uploaded to the STEWARDS database by 
watershed staff per obligations to CEAP Objective 1.    
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 11 
 Protocols for data imports from local sites via in put files with different formats will be developed 
and implemented jointly between the STEWARDS team and the local watersheds. The standard 
exchange file format will have b een jointly determined first. A singl e import filter will be written to 
parse the standard formatted (e.g. ta b-delimited) files from the local watershed sites. In this manner, 
all the data files from the local sites will have cons istent formats when they are stored in the central 
site. The filter developed for the intial population of the database will  be available for use in later 
periodic uploads. 
3.6.3 Updating Data  
Time-series data (measurement data, annual land use information, weather/climate data) and other 
data (spatial data, metadata) will be collected by local watershed staff, pr ocessed through local and 
CEAP QA/QC procedures, and uploaded to the STEW ARDS database on an annual basis using the 
filter developed during the initial population of the database. Requests will initiate from the central 
system per schedule negotiated with individual watersheds. Compliance by watershed staff is 
understood to be expected per obligations unde r CEAP watershed project plans revised to 
accommodate the CEAP project plan objective 1. 
3.6.4 Data derivation/aggregation   
The central database will allow users to access the data of individual watersheds, sub-watersheds on 
a station-by-station basis, or a coll ection of stations if the entire data set is desired. Multiple levels of 
data aggregation of time-series data (daily, monthly, or yearly) will be supported. A great flexibility of export data should be also available in terms of data volume (the number of data entity and time 
coverage) and output format [for example, for ta bular data – comma separated values (csv) or 
database format (dbf); for spatial data – shape file s (shp) or ascii grid file s (grd);  for reports – 
Adobe page definition format (pdf)]. 
4. External Interface Requirements 
4.1 User Interfaces 
The user interface will be simple and consiste nt, using terminology commonly understood by the 
intended users of the system.  The system will have  a simple interface, consistent with industry 
standard interfaces, to eliminate the need for user  training of infrequent users.  The STEWARDS 
team will evaluate the user interface of simila r systems and apply appropriately.  For additional 
details see Appendix E. User testing will be used to ensure the user interface is clear (simple, 
commonly understood vocabulary, intuitive to use w ithout training), complete (users can perform 
all functions from the interface), and consistent  (buttons and wording are the same throughout the 
system).   
4.2 Hardware Interfaces 
No extra hardware interfaces are needed.  The system will use the standard hardware and data 
communications resources provided by the ARS OC IO at the ARS George Washington Carver 
Center in Beltsville, MD. This includes, but is  not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 
connection at the server/hosting site, network server s, and network management tools.  This system 
will include a warning message when a low tran smission speed is detected, and a non-graphical 
interface option will be available. 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 12 
 4.3 Software Interfaces 
The system will use the standard softwa re resources provided by the ARS OCIO.   This includes, but 
is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C#, MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB 
scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server. 
4.4 Communications Interfaces 
The system will use the communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO.  This includes, but 
is not limited to, HTTP protocol for communicati on with the web browser and the web server and 
TCP/IP network protocol with HTTP protocol.  
5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements 
5.1 Performance Requirements 
PR-1: Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the 
number of persons increases. Response tim es seen by end users for querying metadata 
should be on the order of a few seconds or  less. Response times seen by end users for 
retrieving the actual images may take much long er, anywhere from a few minutes to several 
hours. If the user requests a la rge image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the 
ARS data system to advise the user that the ta rget response time cannot be met. In that case, 
the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.   
 
PR-2: Loading speed: The data system shall load  as quickly as comparable productivity tools on 
whatever environment it is running in.  
5.2 Safety Requirements 
Data on the server should be protec ted from power loss but data in tr ansit from server to requester 
could be lost. Given that these data will also re main on the watershed site system, rather than 
expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.  
5.3 Security Requirements 
STEWARDS will have reasonable controls consis tent with ARS OCIO pr actices, in compliance 
with agency, Dept and Govt regulations.  STEWARDS security requirements will have four primary components.  They are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
 SCR-1: Authentication 
STEWARDS will follow industry best practices  for authentication, using single-sign-on 
systems like Microsoft Active Directory to pe rform authentication. Au thentication addresses 
security requirements to ensure those using syst em are who they say they  are.  This is of 
greatest concern when data are being changed or updated.  This is primarily done through 
userids and passwords. 
 SCR-2: Confidentiality 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 13 
 Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately.  
STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of 
information sharing to ensure confidentiality as a ppropriate.   Any data that should be 
viewed by a restricted audience must be prot ected with appropriate security features. 
 SCR-3: Data Integrity 
The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product.  Scientific 
research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system.  Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process.  The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intent ional or unintentional modificati ons, and to ensure accurate 
data are made available. 
 SCR-4: Availability 
The fourth consideration for security requireme nts is availability.  The system must be 
available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week w ith, 99% availability 
and a tolerance of -5% (not le ss than 50% of working hours in any week).  For this system, 
availability will be concerned with the reliabil ity of the software and network components.  
Intentional “denial of service attacks” is  not foreseen as a significant concern.
  
5.4 Software Quality Attributes 
SQ-1:  Portability 
This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.  
 SQ-2:  Adaptability 
Implementation of the application software/code and design of database structure should be 
flexible enough for the necessary change in the later phase.  
 SQ-3:  Availability 
Availability is defined here to mean the abil ity to use the system during its intended period 
of operation as defined in SCR-4 above.

System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 18 
 Appendix F: System Design 
 
System Design Goals : 
 The purpose of system design is to translate the system requirements into more technical 
specifications. Through a user case su rvey and a logical analysis of user’s expectations and system 
functionalities, the system components for STEWAR DS are identified (Fig. F1). System design 
provides a detailed description for each identified  component and produces a physical data system 
design (with documentation) that allow the system developers to construct each component (layer) 
accordingly.  At the end of the system desi gn phase, hardware, software tools and skill 
requirements, and other resources will be identi fied and a system developer team/plan will be 
drawn. After that, the cons truction phase will begins (Task flow of can be seen in  Fig. H1 in 
Appendix H). 
 
System Design Methodology : 
 The system design process can be divided into thr ee main phases: conceptual system design, logical 
system design, and physical system design. In this  appendix, only conceptual system design and 
logical system design for STEWARDS are documen ted. Physical system design (how the logical 
structure of  STEWARDS will be implemented) is  still in a planning stag e and will be described 
later. Physical design, which involves producing a description of the im plementation of logical 
system design, will be tailored to STEWARDS and all physical considerations (including 
tools/software such as Microsoft SQL server, Oracle SQL server etc.) will be specific to 
STEWARDS.  Conceptual System Design: Build a co nceptual data system for STEWARDS 
 
As depicted in the conceptual model of STEWARDS  (Fig. F12), the task underway in this phase is 
to define/identify system components such as:  
1. hardware infrastructure component, 2. data/database component (metadata standards, measurement data),  3. interface/application component (metadata sear ch, measurement data search, data access, 
visualization, data downloads, and their relationships), and  
4. data uploading tool component.  
 The database design and interface/application design parallel each othe r within the system 
development process. The total number of system  components will depend on the level of detail. 
For example, the data component of STEWARDS can  be further identified as watershed climate, 
image, soils, management, pollutant source,  hydrology, socio-economic, water quality data,  data 
search, data downloads etc (Fig. F2). Descript ion for hardware infrastructure design will be 
provided separately. 
 
Logical System Design: Build and validat e the logical data system for STEWARDS 
 
During the logical system design phase, a logical data system (a ll system components and their 
relationships) will be constructed and validated. In other words, the Entity-Relationship (ER) 
diagrams for measurement data and user graphic interfaces (UGIs) to co nnect all components will 
be developed.  For example,  an entity-relationship diagram for measured climate data at South Fork 
watershed, Iowa, is given in Fig. F3. Climate is  an entity (subject) and it becomes a table 
(Topic(Variable)_Table which holds  variables such as min_tempera ture, max_temperature, etc.) in 
the database. The actual (bas ic) climate data is also an entity and has its own table (a table with 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 19 
 yellow background in Fig. F3). Fig. F3 also shows th e relationships between tables.  The tables – 
STEWARDS_Units_lookup_Table, [WS]_Topic_Table, and [WS] _Site_ID_Table are supporting 
data tables to the [WS]_Climate_Daily table. The latt er is the basic data tabl e where climate data are 
stored. Note that the characteristics  (topic) of  a theme (e.g. climate)  in Fig. F3 become the fields 
(min_temperature, max_temperature, etc.). The data descriptors for the basic data table and 
supporting tables are shown in Tables F1 and  F2 respectively.   A generalized data flow and table 
relationship is given in Fig. F4. 
 
Fig. F5. is a diagram in which the data flow and relationship of system co mponents were identified. 
It provides a skeleton of system interface desi gn. Three major system application components are 
identified: overview/summary, system search, and data access/visualizati on/downloads.  For next 
level of detail, the system component diagram fo r access login component, system/summary system 
component, metadata search component, site summary search, component, watershed specific 
search component, topic search component, site specific search component, pre-existing search 
component, characterizing watershe d GIS component,  and data acces s/visualization component are 
given in Figs. F6 to F15. The descriptions for these higher level system components are given in 
another document (Software module design documentation_v2-2.doc at The USDA-ARS ARSNET 
Team 1 Sharepoint site). 
 
Data Importing/Translation : 
 The tasks for importing data from the local sites into the centralized site required the following 
considerations. 
 
1. Assumptions: 
a. Metadata will be compliant at time of pr oduction in the local sites – no translation 
required, just the upload. 
b. Therefore, translating empiri cal data is the only need. 
c. Translation will be local site specific and done there. 
d. A thesaurus of columns and allowed parameter ids (identification ID s) will be developed 
either internal or external to the tran slation team before acting on the below. 
2. There are three types of empirical data we will need to address. 
a. Time series data (Type 1 data) with columns fo r different data collected at the same time. 
Example is flat table of weather data.  A generalized data struct ure for this type of data is 
given in Fig. I1 in Appendix I. 
b. Time series data (Type 2 data), usually more sparse than the above, with an id field that 
explains what the parameter field contains. Ex ample is water quality data.   A generalized 
data structure for this type of data is given in Fig. I2 in Appendix I. 
c. GIS layers. 
3. There are two types of operations we need to consider 
a. Initial population 
i. Build cross-map (mapping method) of  columns and/or parameter ids 
ii. Build units conversions 
iii. Choose QA procedures 
iv. Build translate/upload procedure 
v. Perform initial upload 
vi. Perform check of comple teness in central store 
b. Annual population 
i. Add new columns if needed 
ii. Upload into existing (perhaps  only recently) columns/fields 
System  Requirements Specification for STEWARDS  Page 20 
 iii. Overwrite old data after error identification and correction locally 
iv. Perform check of comple teness in central store 
 
 
The mapping method allows a great fl exibility in terms of data hete rogeneity, table si ze, data type, 
etc.   Physical System Design: Build the specific data  system for STEWARDS in terms of softwares 
and tools. 
  
This phase is under planning.  Fo r software requirements, the p
rogramming skills in developing 
Windows and Web applications us ing Microsoft Visual Studio .N ET (BASICS,  ASP.NET, C++, 
C#),  XHTML, XML programming languages/scripts, Microsoft VISIO 2003  under MS Internet 
Information Services (IIS) and  Micros oft SQL 2000/2005 servers will be pursued.

 Appendix G:  Linkage of STEWARDS to Other USDA/ARS 
Data/Modeling Systems 
 
As an ARS watershed data system to s upport SWAT and AnnAGN PS modeling in CEAP, 
ultimately the STEWARDS data system could be integrated with other similar ARS data/modeling 
systems such as OMS (Object Modeling Syst em), iFARM (Integrated Farm And Ranch 
Management), and other general models (Fig. G1).   
The OMS  is a Java-based modeling framework that facilita tes simulation model development, evaluation, and 
deployment. In general, the OMS  consists of: 1) a library of science, control and database modules; 2) a means to 
assemble selected modules into a modeling package customized to the problem; and 3) automatic generation of a user-friendly interface. The framework employs the latest Java-based software technology for all the components, and is supported by data dictionary, data retrieval, GIS, graphi cal visualization, and statis tical analysis utility modules.

 Appendix I.  Data Structure for Two Type s of Time Series Data in STEWARDS 
 
 
Type 1: Time series data with columns for different data collected at the same time. 
Example is flat table of weathe r data.  Fig. I1 shows a genera lized data structure for this 
type of data. Type 2: Time series data, usually more spar se than the above, with an id field that 
explains what the parameter field contains. Ex ample is water quality data. Fig. I2 show a 
generalized data structure for this type of data.
