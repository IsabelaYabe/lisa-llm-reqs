1. Introduction 
This section of the Software Requirements Speciﬁcation (SRS) document provides the 
purpose of the SRS, copyright and commercial systems disclaimer, scope of the SRS, acronyms 
and abbreviations used in the SRS, the deﬁnition of verbal forms, list of references, and an 
overview of the SRS document’s structure. 
1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this SRS document is to describe the requirements speciﬁcations for 
applications and a data repository to distribute manufacturing data. 
Prospective developers, technical-assessment personnel, and interested end-users are the 
intended audience of this SRS document. 
1.2 Disclaimer 
The work presented in this SRS is an oﬃcial contribution of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) and not subject to copyright in the United States. Cer-
tain commercial systems are identiﬁed in this paper. Such identiﬁcation does not imply 
recommendation or endorsement by NIST. Nor does it imply that the products identiﬁed 
are necessarily the best available for the purpose. 
1.3 Scope 
A software system to distribute manufacturing data via a web service is the application 
being deﬁned by this document. The software system contains two component applica-
tions. The ﬁrst component is an application to stream time-synchronized manufacturing 
data, herein referred to as the Volatile Data Stream (VDS). The second component is an 
application for querying a database containing manufacturing data, herein referred to as the 
Query-able Data Repository (QDR). The two components combined are herein referred to 
as the “software system.” 
The software system enables researchers, practitioners, and solution providers to interact 
with real data generated from a manufacturing facility. The VDS supports real-time data-
monitoring activities. The QDR enables object-of-interest observation. The data distributed 
via the software system enables research in manufacturing-related domains. The distributed 
data also supports the optimization and enhancement of practitioner processes. Lastly, the 
distributed data supports solution-provider development activities, such as designing, coding, 
testing, and debugging software applications.

2. General Description 
This section of the SRS describes the general requirements that drive the design of the 
software system. The goal is not to state speciﬁc requirements, but rather to provide context 
to make those requirements easier to understand. 
2.1 System Perspective 
Distributing manufacturing data across an enterprise requires the curation and man-
agement of the data within a repository and end-user services to access the data. The 
manufacturing data comes from a network of industrial equipment instrumented with sen-
sors and other data-acquisition devices. Without a data-distribution system, data users must 
discover, curate, and integrate manufacturing data manually. The software system described 
in this SRS can enable the automation of the required tasks. 
This SRS describes a software system that is part of a larger manufacturing-monitoring 
system. Figure 1 presents the architecture of the manufacturing-monitoring system. This 
SRS covers the VDS and QDR applications contained in the internal and external data access 
portions of the solution stack presented in Figure 1. 
2.1.1 Volatile Data Stream 
The VDS is an application that executes an MTConnect Agent, which is “a process 
that implements the MTConnect HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol, Extensible 
Markup Language (XML) generation, and MTConnect protocol” [1]. The VDS is a high 
priority for the software system. 
MTConnect is an open-source, read-only, extensible data-exchange standard for manu-
facturing and was originally designed to transform process-related information from propri-
etary to structured-XML formats accessible for monitoring applications [1]. The standard is 
based on HTTP and provides information models and communication protocols to enhance 
the data-acquisition capabilities of manufacturing equipment, systems, and applications and 
enable a plug-and-play environment. Four information models are currently included in 
MTConnect: Devices, Streams, Assets, and Errors. These models are the only established 
common vocabulary and structure for manufacturing equipment data. 
The VDS provides a means for streaming buﬀered data aggregated from the manufac-
turing devices registered in the system. The VDS must provide a report of all data items 
available in the VDS, a near-real-time stream of most current value for each data item, and 
a time series of most recent values collected for each data item available in the VDS buﬀer. 
2.1.2 Query-able Data Repository 
The QDR provides a means for transforming data into structured formats and sharing 
this structured data with users. The data are organized using predeﬁned templates encoded 
in XML Schema Deﬁnition (XSD). These templates must be used to create data queries. The

data must be saved. A Not only Structured Query Language (NoSQL) type of database or 
relational database may be used to save the data. The QDR user would search and retrieve 
data via a template-driven web-based form, an endpoint query, and/or a Representational 
State Transfer (REST)ful Application Programming Interface (API) call. The QDR is a 
high priority for the software system. 
2.2 System Functions 
The system must provide, at a minimum, the following functions in accordance with the 
other requirements described within this SRS document. 
• Provide a data stream through the VDS in a form compliant with MTConnect and 
data templates in the QDR 
• Upload, edit, and create data templates 
• Make all data available over a RESTful API 
• Provide a User Interface (UI) for administration and managing templates and queries 
• Allow the administrator to create predeﬁned user queries with limits set on results by 
a time range (e.g., number of days, hours, minutes), a limited set of query-able data 
elements, or a limited set of records 
• List all data elements 
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics 
Users of the software system include researchers, practicing engineers, and software de-
velopers. All users should be familiar with web technology. Users are knowledgeable of 
software-development processes or manufacturing processes but may not be knowledgeable 
of both. However, users should have a good understanding of the tasks, activities, and 
artifacts of either process in which they may be interested. 
2.4 Operating Environment 
The server-side components of the software system must operate within a Linux operating 
system environment. 
The client-side components of the software system must operate within common web-
browser environments using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
cryptographic protocols at a minimum encryption level of 128 bits. The minimum set of 
browsers that must be supported is: 
• Apple Safari 7+ 
• Google Chrome 44+

• Microsoft Internet Explorer 10+ 
• Mozilla Firefox 40+ 
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints 
Developers may implement the QDR using a data store to curate data and template 
information. All QDR and administrative services must be available over a RESTful API. 
The QDR must be able to curate data collected in batches from the Industrial-Equipment 
Network. At a predetermined time each calendar day, the QDR must process all curated 
data and populate a list of available elements for query. Setup and maintenance of the 
QDR application are the responsibility of the customer. Setup and maintenance include: 
installation, hosting, host-security conﬁguration, and administration. There are no addi-
tional constraints on the VDS other than any deﬁned for an application that executes the 
MTConnect Agent in the standard documentation [1]. 
2.6 User Documentation 
Any user of the software system is the target audience for user documentation generated 
about the software system. A range of short document types (e.g., guidelines, tutorials, 
frequently asked questions) in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and/or Portable Doc-
ument Format (PDF) format must describe the use of the software system. 
2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies 
No speciﬁc assumptions or dependencies are considered at this time.

for user, hardware, software, and communication interfaces are deﬁned. 
3.1 User Interfaces 
This subsection of the SRS deﬁnes the UI requirements for the VDS and QDR. 
3.1.1 Volatile Data Stream 
The UI for the VDS must comply with the requirements of the application that executes 
the MTConnect Agent as deﬁned by the standard documentation [1]. 
3.1.2 Query-able Data Repository 
All pages of the QDR UI should employ an organizational method that separates the 
major sections of the application for easy access. The user should be able to determine the 
sections of the QDR UI currently being viewed using visual cues, such as bold fonts, arrows, 
and highlighting. The application’s major sections should be available from any page of the 
QDR and include the following pages: Query, Help, Introduction, Administration, Login, 
and Logout. 
The user must be presented with a login page when accessing any page, expect a landing or 
front page, as an anonymous user. Administrative tasks and running queries must have a UI. 
The UI for administrative tasks must included the ability to manage Users, manage Groups, 
manage permissions, manage data templates, manage group assignments, and manage query 
templates. The UI for running queries may include the ability to query the database using 
query templates deﬁned by the administrator. All pages should use a consistent visual theme. 
Pop-ups displaying notiﬁcations, error messages, or warnings should use the same theme and 
template as the rest of the application. 
3.2 Hardware Interfaces 
All server-side components must execute on server-class computers. All client-side com-
ponents must execute on workstation-class and personal-class computers. 
3.3 Software Interfaces 
The software interface should follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model for ren-
dering and modeling data objects. The interface must be able to connect to a database to 
store XML schema deﬁned using XSD and data streams. Source and destination formats for 
data must include XML and may also include: Extensible Stylesheet Lanaguage Transfor-
mation (XSLT), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Comma Separated Value (CSV), and

3.4 Communication Interfaces 
The communication architecture must follow the client-server model. Communication 
between the client and server should utilize a REST-compliant web service and must be 
served over HTTP Secure (HTTPS). The client-server communication must be stateless. A 
uniform interface must separate the client roles from the server roles. Communication over 
the VDS must conform to a reference MTConnect data schema [2] using XML. Communica-
tion over the QDR must provide the user with the option of formatted ASCII CSV, JSON, 
or XML structured with a reference MTConnect data schema [2].

Curate/003 The software system may provide all curation functionality via a web-based user 
interface. 
4.3 Software System Administration 
This subsection of the SRS describes the requirements for administering the software 
system. 
4.3.1 Description and Priority 
The software system must provide a function to manage user accounts and data-structure 
templates (e.g., schemas, ontologies). The minimum user account types must be: (1) data 
explorer, (2) data curator, and (3) administrator. The data-explorer account type will grant 
access to end-users for the purpose of interacting with the QDR component of the software 
system. The data-curator account type will grant access to a user for the purpose of storing 
and managing data in the database. The administrator account type will grant “super 
user” access to a user for the purpose of managing the software system. The administration 
function of the software system is a medium priority. 
4.3.2 Functional Requirements 
Admin/001 The software system must provide a web-based UI to CRUD manage users. 
Admin/002 The software system must provide the administrator with the ability to CRUD 
manage users. 
Admin/003 The software system must provide the administrator with the ability to CRUD 
manage groups.

Admin/004 The software system must provide the administrator with the ability to CRUD 
manage user group assignments. 
Admin/005 The software system must provide the administrator with the ability to CRUD 
manage permissions assigned to users and groups. 
Admin/006 The software system must provide a web-based user interface for CRUD manage 
data templates. 
Admin/007 The software system must provide the administrator with the ability to CRUD 
manage data-structure templates using the XSD format. 
Admin/008 The software system may provide all administration functionality via a RESTful 
API. 
Admin/009 The software system must allow the administrator to create a Universally Unique 
Identiﬁer (UUID) associated with a device. 
Admin/010 The software system must require a UUID to be provided with any data streams 
uploaded.

5. Non-functional Requirements 
This section of the SRS describes the non-functional requirements for the software system. 
Performance, reliability, availability, security, and maintainability requirements are included. 
In addition, business rules are deﬁned. 
5.1 Performance Requirements 
The VDS must provide available fresh data to the requesting client at a rate of no less than 
1 Hz. The response-time for the QDR should be minimized using industry recommended 
practices. All other performance related to storage, memory, and processing should follow 
industry recommended practices to ensure resource requirements are minimized. 
5.2 Reliability Requirements 
There are no requirements for Mean Time between Failures (MTBF) or Mean Time 
to Failures (MTTF) for this version of the software system deﬁned in this SRS. However, 
in accordance with industry recommended practices, the software system should undergo 
feature testing, load testing, and regression testing prior to release and/or deployment. 
5.3 Availability Requirements 
Reasonable eﬀorts should be made to ensure the software system is available with an 
uptime of 95%. The uptime is calculated as the percentage of time during the year in which 
the software system was available to the public. A 95% uptime percentage allows for an 
average of 18.25 days per year, 36 hours per month, or 8.4 hours per week of downtime. 
5.4 Security Requirements 
The software system deﬁned in this SRS must follow industry recommended practices for 
secure software development. At a minimum, the software development must practice the 
principle of least privilege for deﬁning access-level requirements of the software system and 
its associated services. The production-release version of the software system must pass an 
automated dynamic application security testing tool (e.g., HP WEBINSPECT). 
5.5 Maintainability Requirements 
The architecture, design, implementation, and documentation of the application must 
minimize the maintenance costs of the software system. The maximum person-time required 
to ﬁx a security defect (including regression testing and documentation update) must not 
exceed two person days. Otherwise, the software system must be taken oﬄine or the oﬀending 
feature disabled. The average person-time required to make a minor enhancement (including 
testing and documentation update) must not exceed one person week.

5.6 Business Rules 
The system must have at least a Super-User role and a User role deﬁned for accessing 
and interacting with the system. Additional roles may be deﬁned for the system as long 
as the business rules for the administrator and user roles are satisﬁed. At a minimum, the 
Super-User role must account for the data explorer , data curator , and administrator account-
type requirements described in Section 4.3. At a minimum, the User role must account for 
the data explorer account-type requirements described in Section 4.3. The following business 
rules must apply to the administrator and user roles. 
5.6.1 Super-User Role Business Rules 
SuperUserRole/001 Maintains all VDS and QDR back-end system conﬁgurations 
SuperUserRole/002 Maintains all VDS and QDR schemas and templates 
SuperUserRole/003 Maintains all user groups and user accounts 
SuperUserRole/004 Maintains all QDR predeﬁned queries 
5.6.2 User Role Business Rules 
UserRole/001 Connects to and retrieves and reads data from VDS and QDR in conformance 
with the maintained VDS and QDR schemas and templates
