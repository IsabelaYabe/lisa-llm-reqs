COMMS SRS FOR DII-COE■11 J ULY 1997 1-1Section 1
Scope
1.1  Identification
This Subsystem Requirement Specification (SRS) describes Communications Services
of the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment(COE).
1.2  Communications Services Overview
The Communications Services area of the DII-COE is defined as frame work forsupporting connectivity and data exchange between a given autonomous system andother autonomous systems.
1.2.1  Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model
A discussion of the DII Communications Services requirements necessitates abackground presentation of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.The OSI model, portrayed in Figure 1, is the model used for data communications inthe DII COE. Each of the seven layers in the model represents one or more services orprotocols (a set of rules governing communications between systems), which definethe functional operation of Communications between user and network elements.Each layer (with the exception of the top layer) provides services for the layer aboveit. This model aims at establishing open systems operation and implies standards-based implementation. It strives to permit different systems to accomplish completeinteroperability and quality of operation throughout the network.
The seven layers of the OSI model are structured to facilitate independent
development within each layer and to provide for changes independent of otherlayers. Stable international standard protocols in conformance with the OSI referencemodel layer definitions have been published by various standards organizations.

Figure 1  Open Systems Interconnection model
While the OSI model is useful for explaining the mechanics of communications, the
scope of the DII COE Communication service is defined in the DoD TechnicalArchitecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM). The TAFIM definescommunication services in the following areas:
1. Message Transfer Services
2. Voice Communications3. Visual Services4. Information Transfer Services5. Information Technical Service Management6. Network Services
1.2.2  Message Transfer Services
Message Transfer services include the following requirements:
1. Personal Message Transfer services, including the capability to send, receive,
forward, store, display, and manage personal messages. This includes thecapability to append attachments such as files and documents to messages.

COMMS SRS FOR DII-COE■11 J ULY 1997 1-3SCOPE■SECTION 1
Messages may include any combination of data, text, audio, graphics, and images
and should be capable of being formatted into standard data interchange formats.This service includes the use of directories and distribution lists for routinginformation, the ability to assign priorities, the use of pre-formatted electronicforms, and the capability to trace the status of messages throughout thecommunication pipeline. Associated services include a summarized listing ofincoming messages, a log of messages received and read, the ability to file or printmessages, and the ability to reply to or forward messages.
2. Organizational Message Transfer services, including the capability to send,
receive, forward, display, retrieve, prioritize, and manage predefined andunformatted organizational messages. Organizational messages should usestandard data interchange formats and may include any combination of data, text,audio, graphics, and images. This includes the capability to review andauthenticate messages. Incoming message processing services include receipt,validation, distribution, and dissemination of incoming unformatted messagesbased on message profiling, message precedence, and system security restrictions.Outgoing message processing services include coordination by Site's stafforganizations, authorized release, and verification of record messages prior totransmission. User support services include the selection and display of messagesfrom a message queue, on-line management of search profiles, search andretrieval of stored messages based on message content comparison to queriesformulated by the analysts, and composition of record messages wrappers fortransmission.
3. Enhanced telephony services, including call forwarding, call waiting,
programmed directories, teleconferencing, automatic call distribution (useful forbusy customer service areas), and call detail recording. Enhanced telephonyservice also includes precedence and preemption capabilities.
4. Shared screen services that provide audio teleconferencing with common
workstation windows between two or more users. This includes the capability torefresh windows whenever someone displays new material or changes an existingdisplay. Every user has the capability to graphically annotate or modify the sharedconference window.
5. Teleconferencing services that provide two-way video or multi-port transmission
between different sites. These services include:
■full motion display of events
■participants in a bi-directional manner
■support for the management of directing the cameras including:
■ranging from fixed position
■sender directed
■receiver directed
■automated sound pickup
6. Broadcast services that provide one-way audio or audio/video communications
1-4 COMMS SRS FOR DII-COE■11 J ULY 1997SECTION 1■SCOPE
services between a sending location and multiple receiving locations. Broadcast
services also includes data communications services.
■Combat Net Radio services that provide audio communications betweenmultiple sending and receiving locations.
■Conferencing services that allow groups to participate in conferences. Theseconferences may not occur in real time. Conferees or invited guests can drop inor out of conferences or subconferences at will. The ability to trace theexchanges is provided. Services include exchange of documents, conferencemanagement, recording facilities, and search and retrieval capabilities.
One end of the Message Transfer service is bounded by and includes the logical
system input/output devices. This does not necessarily include down-lineconveyance vehicles such as cryptos, modems, radios, etc. The other end ofCommunication service is bounded by and includes the message collection anddistribution functions supporting client applications and other service areas such asthe Message Processing Services. A notional communications architecture is depictedin Figure 2. Using this definition of the Message Transfer service and its boundariesallows for a segregatable and certifiable (where appropriate) communicationssubsystem that can be utilized for DII COE with controlled mechanism for handlingextensions and customizations of services.
COMMS SRS FOR DII-COE■11 J ULY 1997 1-5SCOPE■SECTION 1
Figure 2  Notional Communications Architecture
These services allow a user to prepare, send, and receive messages. The most
fundamental Message Transfer service supports text-based Message Transfer only.Increasingly more sophisticated Message Transfer services provide support forvarious types and formats of information in addition to text, and will include datafiles, graphics, facsimile, and voice. The Message Transfer services used by all DoDinclude two main categories:
1. The Automated Data Information Network (AUTODIN) provides the current
capabilities for organizational Message Transfer services for USMTF messages.
2. The Defense Message System (DMS) will provide target capabilities for personal
and organizational Message Transfer services to eventually replace AUTODIN.
However, the Message Transfer services include many other DoD service specific
networks, interfaces, and protocols that provide for information transfer between sitesand systems.
The term “message” refers to the logical collection of data bits bundled by applying
the rules for the format of the data (character-oriented, bit-oriented, graphics, voice,

1-6 COMMS SRS FOR DII-COE■11 J ULY 1997SECTION 1■SCOPE
data, etc.). For example; Formatted Record messages are bounded by applying the
rules of JANAP 128, ACP 126M, ACP 127, etc. Tactical Data Information Link TacticalData Link (TADIL) binary messages are bounded by frame labels indicating theapplicable series message and the fixed size of the given message. These messages arebounded by applying the rules of OS411 and OS516. A graphics for such as TIF, BMP,etc.etc has a specified format as do audio files.
Record Message Handling: This class of messages usually consists of formatted
messages (military examples include OTH GOLD, USMTF, etc.) within a standardwrapper (military examples include JANAP 128, ACP 126M, etc.) Subsequentdistribution of messages/data by Message Processing Software or other clientapplications is external to Communications service. The services provided byMessage Processing Software will handle posting messages for human consumptionin the appropriate electronic mail box as well as automatically processing messagesfor computer consumption to update system databases.
Binary Message Handling: Some communications interfaces may have client message
encoders and decoders (from message processing) which will interact more directlywith the interface conveying data to and from database engine(s) of the system wheremessage logging, accounting, and other features used for record messages, do notapply. Should those features be applied they would adversely affect the timelinessand usefulness of the data. This class of messages usually consists of high speed/volume binary data which is decoded and encoded by commonly structuredmessage/data client services and capable of interacting with other common systemAPI structures.
Message Transfer services includes such areas as physical interfaces, protocols,
interface control, data bounding into messages, message identification, messagestorage, message retrieval, message logging, message notification, message alerting,message queuing, message validation, message collection, and message distribution.
In postal service terms, the Message Transfer Service looks at the envelope of the
message not the actual content. The envelope conveys information about the source,destination and priority of the message; whereas a user or client application handlesthe processing of the actual message content.
In terms of the OSI Reference Model, the DII COE Message Transfer services notional
architecture (See Figure 2) can be described in terms of the 7 layer reference model (SeeFigure 3). In this context, client applications (layer 7) are establishing virtualconnections to their counterpart applications on remote hosts via the MessageTransfer services of DII COE. Data flows amongst these client applications withouttheir direct involvement or knowledge of the underlying conveyance mechanisms.Although this model is useful for describing interfaces between open systems somedifficulties are found when applying the model to older/closed system architecturesthat will continue to interface to DII COE. Although these older systems/interfacesare being phased out, it will still be many years before that happens. Therefore, it isimportant to propose a communications service solution that handles legacy as wellas emerging communication technologies with an effective infrastructure that
COMMS SRS FOR DII-COE■11 J ULY 1997 1-7SCOPE■SECTION 1
supports simultaneous instances of these technologies.
Figure 3  Notional Architecture and OSI Layers
Figure 4 presents a depiction of the relationship between Communications and
Messaging and indicates at a high level how the various services interact to providefor Communications and Messaging services.

Figure 4  Nominal Communications and Messaging
1.2.3  Voice Communications
These services provide inter-human voice communications and include real-time
(e.g., plain-old-telephone-service and air-to-ground) and stored voice messages.Telephone services and radio services are specialized forms of voice communicationsservices. An overall voice communications service may actually consist of individualtelephone services and radio services. The voice communications services mustemploy information transfer services for actual voice transmission.
1.2.4  Visual Services
These services generally provide mechanisms for capturing, processing, transferring,and displaying visual information. This service area includes imagery, video, andfacsimile. The services for transferring the visual information are in addition to the

COMMS SRS FOR DII-COE■11 J ULY 1997 1-9SCOPE■SECTION 1
information transfer services. Visual services must employ information transfer
services for actual information transmission.
1.2.5  Information Transfer (IT) Services
These services support the transfer of C 4I information (e.g., voice, data, video,
messages, images, etc.) between users and/or C 4I systems.
1.2.6  Information Technical Service Management
Services supporting the management, integration, accounting, and security of the
other IT Services and the systems, facilities, and resources comprising those services.This service includes specific services such as network management, messagemanagement, and electronic key management.
1.2.7  Network Services
Network services are provided to support distributed applications requiring dataaccess and applications interoperability in heterogeneous or homogeneous networkedenvironments. They include the following functional areas:
1.Data communications , which include protocols for reliable, transparent,
end-to-end data transmission across communications networks.
2.Personal/microcomputer support for interoperability with systems based on a
variety of operating systems.
1.2.7.1  Internet Protocol Suite (IPS)
The Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) is based on the Internet Protocol (IP) and
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which were developed within the U.S. military-funded research establishment and have since grown to become the basis of theworldwide Internet, is generally referred to as the TCP/IP Protocol Suite.Standardization of the IPS is carried out by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
The IPS, although neither required nor precluded by GOSIP, is widely used by Federal
agencies. Today there is significantly more actual interoperation within and betweenFederal agencies using IPS than using OSI standards, as well as between Federalagencies and the public. The Profile for Open Systems Internetting Technologies(POSIT) as described in FIPS Publication 146.2 and the Government NetworkManagement Profile (GNMP) as described in FIPS Publications 179.1 have beenselected as the guidance documents for internet access.
