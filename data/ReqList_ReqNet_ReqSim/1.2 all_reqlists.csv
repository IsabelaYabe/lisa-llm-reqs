0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.29,"Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation)."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.30,"Use of “white space”: “White space” on a page i.e.  space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.31,"Selecting appropriate page lengths: The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.32,"Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness)."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.33,"Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.34,"Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation:  If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user t o read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.35,"Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.36,Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.37,"Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 ab out direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility."

0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.40,"Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area."
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.41,Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the frameset s in the pages of the application.
0000 - cctns.txt,G.D0.6.42,"Individualization and user adaptation: Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with me and for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group."

1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.8.2,"Also, from a human engineering perspective, user interfaces for different access levels should be uniform across all subsystems, though different access levels should present different `look-and-feels'."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.0.1,"Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, all requirements and modes presented are intended to be available to all users of the system."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.0.2,"It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations must fulfill all possible requirements, but it does not mean that all features will be made available to all users at all locations at all times."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.0.3,The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the project.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.1.1,"To allow observing astronomers to achieve this objective, the system must offer to a user an interface which, while fulfilling the various operational requirements in the different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at any required level, is still simple to learn and secure in its use."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.1.2,"Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope is concerned. They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time. The intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. Programs, as opposed to observers, may have the capability of direct control of the telescope. This would allow the observer to create an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount. Astronomers are typically given control access to instruments, however."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.1.3,Traditional interactive operation shall normally be replaced by operation via an automatic sequencer. This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and flexible scheduling (as defined later in Section 2.7 on page 2-12).
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.1.4,"A certain degree of interaction shall be provided, meaning in this case that the user will interact with the scheduler program, rather than with the control programs directly."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.1.5,Observing commands will normally be submitted via the User interface to a queue for later execution. It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue. e.g. as a result of the quality assessment of previous data.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.1.6,"In particular, Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation, but this shall not be considered as the normal operation mode for the reasons explained in Section2.7 on page 2-12. It is evident that, for some functions (such as adjustment of spectrograph slit width for seeing conditions) it must be necessary to include interactive capability. However each instance of such a function should be examined as a candidate for automation - such as focusing."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.1.7,The existence of the scheduling queue shall be transparent to the on-site observer during the initial phases of telescope operation. Only after experience has been gained with the system will the existence of the queue become evident to the onsite observer.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.2.1,Operations staff will control the Gemini 8m Telescopes indirectly via a scheduler program or directly via commands. They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently. They shall also monitor general performance and system safety.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.2.2,"Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures in case of problems. This includes direct control of physical units. However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation. If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures have to be run."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.2.3,"Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observing astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of filters mounted on an instrument). Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument requirements in this area."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.5.9.2.4,They shall be able to change the operational status of units according to the results of tests performed on such units (e.g. to see if a faulty unit can be declared as operational again and redefined as part of the environment in use).
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.6.4.1,"The requirements to have instruments operated as single units imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 8m Telescopes. On these user stations, different kinds of users may be working at the same time with the Gemini 8m Telescopes software."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.6.4.2,"Independently of the location of users at the telescope site, they shall be able to access (according to their privileges) any part of the whole setup with a simple logon and configuration operation. In other words. any subsection of the whole Gemini 8m Telescopes system should be accessible and controllable from any single point (but of course with protection ensuring security and safety)."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.6.4.3,"Monitoring shall exist both in the form of automatic displays of status information at different locations, and in the form of explicit access to the required status information from any point."

1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.1.3,It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.1.4,Interactive observing with time allocation for full nights is a first basic requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes. It is therefore an essential requirement that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way in this mode.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.1.5,Interaction will normally be via an automatic sequencer (see Section 2.5.9 on page 2-6). This is clearly a top priority requirement and one which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode. The initial implementation of the automatic sequencer will operate in a pass through mode where all commands are accepted and transmitted with minimal checking and delay.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.2.1,"The observing program must be fully automated, requiring very little human interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include a sufficiently rich programming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to the astronomer."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.2.2,"There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer to test observing programs for completeness, errors, and functionality. This simulator should function within the virtual telescope environment of the Gemini system."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.2.3,All control software must provide support for simulated use within the virtual telescope.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.2.4,"There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both within an observing program and across observing programs, in order to optimize observing efficiency. This software must consider target positions, weather conditions, and instrument configurations."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.2.5,"There must be software to support the flexible scheduling, both manually and via a scheduler, allowing for the interleaving of observing programs in a manner that is transparent to the individual observing programs. This includes managing the collection of science, environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.2.6,"To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments. These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences. It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue. This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences, current site conditions, and other rules established by the observatory directorate."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.0.1,All software should be developed to permit remote operations. There should be no conceptual difference between software working on-site and remotely.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.0.2,All observing facilities should work both on-site and of f-site. It should be possible to do full operations remotely.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.0.3,"Team observing, with multiple observers at different sites should be supported."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.0.4,"It must be possible to restrict specific operations to specific remote sites. For example, at the Mauna Kea site, remote telescope control might be restricted to Hale Pohaku. The method used to restrict such operations should be independent of the operations themselves, and dynamic."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.0.5,"Despite the obvious limitations introduced by the link bandwidths available at the different locations, the system shall be totally transparent to local or remote use.   It is only necessary that the functionality of the system be transparent, it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system. However the system design should minimize the impact of link bandwidth on transparency."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.0.6,Security of operation shall be considered and might imply different operation levels and privileges at different sites.
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.2.1,"Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a remote site such as Cerro Tololo, Hilo or even home Institutes. This possibility has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.3.2.2,Remote users shall normally interact with the system via ·operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility ·operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site facility ·operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facility ·operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility ·via the scheduler program and shall not control any part of the Gemini 8m Telescopes directly.

1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.4.2,"This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer, for developing the program, and to the observer, for review and adjustment of the program. This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.7.4.3,"The programming environment should allow for the communication of special notes, instructions, and comments from the astronomer to the observer, possibly involving multi-media techniques. The use of this feature would, however, be discouraged for queue-based observing."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.8.1.1,"To achieve efficient service observing, queue observing, and flexible scheduling, it should be possible to carry out observations automatically, in accordance with predefined sequences of exposures, as is commonly done in space observatories."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.9.1.1,"The syntax of control flow commands is to be consistent across the system, whether accessing workstation software or IOC software. See Section 3.2.5 on page 3-6."

1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.9.1.6,"Peak control information within the system is expected to be 100 TPS. This assumes bridging between communication sections, to isolate traffic in relevant sections only."
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.9.2.1.1.1,Data from detectors must be stored in the most effective method permitted by available technology. Astronomical data is often detector readout limited so that disk access and data transfer times are not significant. Maximum acceptable readout time for detector data is very dependent on detector type and size as well as the intended application:
1995 - gemini.txt,G.D3.2.9.2.1.1.2,"For focusing and related activities, maximum acceptable detector readout time is about0.1 sec, though only a portion of the detector may be read during that time."

2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.2.1,Watershed data to be used in modeling that does not conform to model requirements will be processed in STEWARDS for inclusion in the STEWARDS databases.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.2.2,"Protocols for data imports from local sites via input files with different formats will be developed and implemented jointly between the STEWARDS team and the local watersheds. The standard exchange file format will have been jointly determined first. A single import filter will be written to parse the standard formatted (e.g. tab-delimited) files from the local watershed sites. In this manner, all the data files from the local sites will have consistent formats when they are stored in the central site. The filter developed for the initial population of the database will be available for use in later periodic uploads."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.3.0,"Time-series data (measurement data, annual land use information, weather/climate data) and other data (spatial data, metadata) will be collected by local watershed staff, processed through local and CEAP QA/QC procedures, and uploaded to the STEW ARDS database on an annual basis using the filter developed during the initial population of the database."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.3.1,Requests will initiate from the central system per schedule negotiated with individual watersheds.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.3.2,Compliance by watershed staff is understood to be expected per obligations under CEAP watershed project plans revised to accommodate the CEAP project plan objective 1.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.4.0,"The central database will allow users to access the data of individual watersheds, sub-watersheds on a station-by-station basis, or a collection of stations if the entire data set is desired."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.4.1,"Multiple levels of data aggregation of time-series data (daily, monthly, or yearly) will be supported."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.3.6.4.2,"A great flexibility of export data should be also available in terms of data volume (the number of data entity and time coverage) and output format [for example, for tabular data – comma separated values (csv) or database format (dbf); for spatial data – shape file s (shp) or ascii grid file s (grd);"
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.4.1.0,"The user interface will be simple and consistent, using terminology commonly understood by the intended users of the system.  The system will have a simple interface, consistent with industry standard interfaces, to eliminate the need for user training of infrequent users."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.4.1.1,The STEWARDS team will evaluate the user interface of similar systems and apply appropriately.  For additional details see Appendix E.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.4.1.2,"User testing will be used to ensure the user interface is clear (simple, commonly understood vocabulary, intuitive to use without training), complete (users can perform all functions from the interface), and consistent (buttons and wording are the same throughout the system)."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.4.2.1,"No extra hardware interfaces are needed.  The system will use the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OC IO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hosting site, network server s, and network management tools.  This system will include a warning message when a low transmission speed is detected, and a non-graphical interface option will be available."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.4.3.1,"The system will use the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO.   This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C#, MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.4.4.1,"The system will use the communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO.  This includes, but is not limited to, HTTP protocol for communication with the web browser and the web server and TCP/IP network protocol with HTTP protocol."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.1.1,Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.1.1.1,"Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less. Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.1.1.2,"If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met. In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.1.2,Loading speed: The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.2.1,"Data on the server should be protected from power loss but data in transit from server to requester could be lost. Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.3.0,"STEWARDS will have reasonable controls consistent with ARS OCIO practices, in compliance with agency, Dept and Govt regulations.  STEWARDS security requirements will have four primary components. They are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.3.1,"STEWARDS will follow industry best practices  for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication. Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they  are.  This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated.  This is primarily done through userids and passwords."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.3.2,Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately. STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate.   Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.3.3,"The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product.  Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system. Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process.  The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.3.4,"The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability.  The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not le ss than 50% of working hours in any week).  For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components. Intentional “denial of service attacks” is not foreseen as a significant concern."
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.4.1,This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.4.2,Implementation of the application software/code and design of database structure should be flexible enough for the necessary change in the later phase.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.5.4.3,Availability is defined here to mean the ability to use the system during its intended period of operation as defined in SCR-4 above.
2006 - stewards.txt,G.D38.6.1.1,GUI and dynamic web applications will be used as much as possible in the ARS data System.

2007 - eirene fun 7.txt,G.D40.11.4.3,"The correspondence between the locations and the destination of the call shall be easily re-configurable to support dynamic changes in controller area boundaries (eg controller area boundaries will change from peak to off-peak periods during the working day or over longer periods, areas may change to match changes in railway organisation or traffic demand)."
2007 - eirene fun 7.txt,G.D40.11.4.4,"When operating with location dependent addressing, no manual action shall be required to update the system when a mobile moves between locations."
2007 - eirene fun 7.txt,G.D40.11.4.5,The location dependent addressing scheme shall be available to all mobiles.
